Power of trustees of renewable leaseholds to renew and to raise money for the purpose\n        (1) A trustee of any leaseholds for lives or years which are renewable from time to time, either under any covenant or contract, or by custom or usual practice, may, if he thinks fit, and shall if thereto required by any person having any beneficial interest, present or future or contingent, in the leaseholds, use his best endeavours to obtain a renewed lease of the same lands on the accustomed and reasonable terms, and for that purpose may make or concur in making a surrender of the lease for the time being subsisting, and do all such other acts as are requisite: Provided that, when by the terms of the settlement or will the person in possession for his life or other limited interest is entitled to enjoy the trust property without any obligation to renew or to contribute to the expense of renewal, the consent in writing of that person must be obtained to the renewal on the part of the trustee.\n        (2) If money is required to pay for the renewal, the trustee effecting the renewal may pay the same out of any money then in his hands in trust for the persons beneficially interested in the lands to be comprised in the renewed lease, and if he has not in his hands sufficient money for the purpose, he may raise the money required by mortgage of the lands to be comprised in the renewed lease, or of any other lands for the time being subject to the uses or trusts to which those lands are subject; and any person advancing money upon a mortgage purporting to be given under this power is not bound to see that the money is wanted, or that no more is raised than is wanted for the purpose.\n        (3) Nothing in this section shall authorize a trustee to do anything which he is in express terms forbidden to do, or to omit to do anything which he is in express terms directed to do, by the instrument creating the trust.\n\n23.

Power of executors and trustees to compound, &c.\n        (1) An executor, trustee, or administrator may pay or allow any debt or claim on any evidence that he thinks sufficient.\n        (2) An executor or administrator or two or more trustees acting together, or a sole acting trustee when by the instrument, if any, creating the trust a sole trustee is authorized to execute the trusts and powers thereof, may –\n                (a) if and as he or they may think fit, accept any composition or any security, real or personal, for any debt or for any property, real or personal, claimed;\n                (b) allow any time for payment for any debt; and\n                (c) compromise, compound, abandon, submit to arbitration, or otherwise settle any debt, account, claim, or thing whatever relating to the testator's or intestate's estate or to the trust –\n        and for any of those purposes may enter into, give, execute, and do such agreements, instruments of composition or arrangement, releases, and other things as to him or them seem expedient, without being responsible for any loss occasioned by any act or thing so done by him or them in good faith.\n        (3) This section applies only if and as far as a contrary intention is not expressed in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, and has effect subject to the terms of that instrument, and to the provisions therein contained.\n\n25. Powers of two or more trustees exercisable by survivor\n        (1) Where a power or trust is given to or vested in two or more trustees jointly, then, unless the contrary is expressed in the instrument, if any, creating the power or trust, the same may be exercised or performed by the survivor or survivors of them for the time being.\n        (2) . . . . . . . .\n        (3) . . . . . . . .\n        (4) . . . . . . . .\n        (5) . . . . . . . .\n\n25AA.

or\n                (b) if the donor is in this State when he executes it, comes into operation when he leaves this State.\n        (9) A power of attorney under this section that authorizes the donee to act for the donor while he is temporarily out of this State ceases to operate on the donor's return to this State.\n        (10) Notwithstanding that a power of attorney under this section –\n                (a) has never come into operation;\n                (b) has ceased to operate; or\n                (c) has been revoked by the act of the donor of the power or his death or by operation of law –\n        any act done or instrument executed by the donee of the power is as valid and effectual in favour of a person dealing with the donee as if the power had come into operation and remained in operation or been unrevoked at the time when the act was done or the instrument was executed, unless that person had, at that time, actual notice that the power had never come into operation, had ceased to operate, or had been revoked.\n        (11) Notwithstanding that the donor of a power of attorney under this section has not obtained the consent or consents required by subsection (5) , any act done, or instrument executed, by the donee of the power is as valid and effectual in favour of a person dealing with the donee as if that consent or those consents had been properly obtained, unless that person had, at the time when the act was done or the instrument was executed, actual notice that the consent or consents had not been obtained.\n        (12) A statutory declaration by the donee of a power of attorney under this section relating to any trust or estate that –\n                (a) the power has come into operation; or\n                (b) in any transaction the donee is acting in the execution of the trust, or the administration of the estate, to which the power relates –\n        is, in favour of a person dealing with the donee of the power, conclusive evidence of that fact.\n        (13) The fact that it appears from a power of attorney under this section, or from any evidence required for the purposes of such a power of attorney or otherwise, that in any transaction the donee of the power is acting in the execution of a trust does not affect with notice of the trust a person dealing in good faith with the donee.\n        (14) Where it is intended that the donee of a power of attorney under this section shall be entitled to transfer, or otherwise deal with, land to which the Land Titles Act 1980 applies, the power shall be in the form, and executed and attested in the manner, prescribed by that Act.\n        (15) Nothing in this section limits or affects –\n                (a) the power of appointment of a new trustee in the place of a trustee who is absent from this State; or\n                (b) the power of the court to make any order by reason of that absence.\n        (16) In this section, trustee includes a tenant for life.\n\n25A.

Exoneration of trustees in respect of certain powers of attorney\n        (1) A trustee, executor, or administrator acting or paying money in good faith under or in pursuance of any power of attorney shall not be liable for any such act or payment by reason of the fact that at the time of the payment or act the person who gave the power of attorney was dead or had done some act to avoid the power, if this fact was not known to the trustee at the time of his so acting or paying.\n        (2) Nothing in this section shall affect the right of any person entitled to the money as against the person to whom the payment is made; and the person so entitled shall have the same remedy against the person to whom the payment is made as he would have had against the trustee.\n\n27. Implied indemnity of trustees\n        (1) A trustee shall, without prejudice to the provisions of the instrument, if any, creating the trust, be chargeable only for money and securities actually received by him notwithstanding his signing any receipt for the sake of conformity, and shall be answerable and accountable only for his own acts, receipts, neglects, or defaults, and not for those of any other trustee, nor for any banker, broker, or other person with whom any trust moneys or securities may be deposited, nor for the insufficiency or deficiency of any securities, nor for any other loss, unless the same happens through his own wilful default.\n        (2) A trustee may reimburse himself, or pay or discharge out of the trust estate, all expenses incurred in or about the execution of his trusts or powers.\n\n28.

Power of trustees to make advances to beneficiaries\n        (1) Trustees may at any time pay or apply any capital money subject to a trust, for the advancement or benefit, in such manner as they may, in their absolute discretion think fit, of any person entitled to the capital of the trust property or of any share thereof, whether absolutely or contingently on his attaining any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, or subject to a gift over on his death under any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, and whether in possession or in remainder or reversion, and such payment or application may be made notwithstanding that the interest of such person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation, or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which he belongs: Provided that –\n                (a) the money so paid or applied for the advancement or benefit of any person shall not exceed altogether in amount one-half of the presumptive or vested share or interest of that person in the trust property;\n                (b) if that person is or becomes absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to a share in the trust property the money so paid or applied shall be brought into account as part of such share;\n                (c) no such payment or application shall be made so as to prejudice any person entitled to any prior life or other interest, whether vested or contingent, in the money paid or applied unless such person is in existence and of full age and consents in writing to such payment or application.\n        (2) This section applies only where the trust property consists of money or securities or of property held upon trust for sale, calling in, and conversion, and such money or securities, or the proceeds of such sale, calling in, and conversion are not by statute or in equity considered as land, or applicable as capital for the purposes of the Settled Land Act 1884 .\n        (3) This section does not apply to trusts constituted or created before the commencement of this Act.\n\n30.

Vesting order in place of conveyance by certain persons under disability\n    Where any person entitled to or possessed of any property, or entitled to a contingent right in any property by way of security for money, is an infant, or an involuntary patient within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2013 , the Court may make an order vesting or releasing or disposing of the property or right in like manner as in the case of an infant trustee.\n\n37. Vesting order in place of conveyance by representative of mortgagee\n    Where a mortgagee of property has died without having entered into the possession or into the receipt of the rents and profits thereof, and the money due in respect of the mortgage has been paid to a person entitled to receive the same, or the last-mentioned person consents to any order for the reconveyance of the property, then the Court may make an order vesting the property in such persons in such manner and for such estate as the Court may direct in any case where –\n            (a) the representative of the mortgagee is out of the jurisdiction of the Court or cannot be found;\n            (b) the representative of the mortgagee, on demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled to require a conveyance of the property, has stated in writing that he will not convey the same, or does not convey the same for the space of 28 days next after a proper deed or document for conveying the property has been tendered to him by or on behalf of the person so entitled;\n            (c) it is uncertain as to the survivor of several devisees of the mortgagee, or as to the representative of the mortgagee, whether he is living or dead; or\n            (d) there is no representative of a mortgagee who has died intestate as to the land, or where the mortgagee has died and it is uncertain who is his representative.\n\n38.

Vesting order consequential on judgment for specific performance\n    Where a judgment is given for the specific performance of a contract concerning any land, or for the partition, or sale in lieu of partition or exchange, of any land, and generally when a judgment is given for the conveyance of any land either in cases arising out of the doctrine of election or otherwise, the Court may declare that any of the parties to the action are trustees of the land or any part thereof within the meaning of this Act, or may declare that the interests of unborn persons who might claim under any party to the action, or under the will or voluntary settlement of any person deceased who was during his lifetime a party to the contract or transactions concerning which the judgment is given, are the interests of persons who, on coming into existence, would be trustees within the meaning of this Act, and thereupon the Court may make a vesting order relating to the rights of those persons, born and unborn, as if they had been trustees.\n\n40. Effect of vesting order\n    A vesting order made under any of the foregoing provisions shall, in the case of a vesting order consequential on the appointment of a new trustee, have the same effect as if the persons who before the appointment were the trustees, if any, had duly executed all proper conveyances of the property for such estate as the Court directs, or if there is no such person, or no such person of full capacity, then as if such person had existed and been of full capacity and had duly executed all proper conveyances of the property for such estate as the Court directs, and shall in every other case have the same effect as if the trustee or other person or description or class of persons to whose rights or supposed rights the said provisions respectively relate had been an ascertained and existing person of full capacity, and had executed a conveyance or release to the effect intended by the order.\n\n41. Power to appoint person to convey\n    In all cases where a vesting order can be made under any of the foregoing provisions the Court may, if it is more convenient, appoint a person to convey or transfer the property or release the contingent right; and a conveyance, transfer, or release by that person in conformity with the order shall have the same effect as an order under the appropriate provision.\n\n42. Persons entitled to apply for orders\n        (1) An order under this Act for the appointment of a new trustee or concerning any property subject to a trust, may be made on the application of any person beneficially interested in the property, whether under disability or not, or on the application of any person duly appointed trustee thereof.\n        (2) An order under this Act concerning any property subject to a mortgage may be made on the application of any person beneficially interested in the equity of redemption, whether under disability or not, or of any person interested in the money secured by the mortgage.\n\n43.

Power to charge costs on trust estate\n    The Court may order the costs and expenses of and incident to any application for an order appointing a new trustee, or for a vesting order, or of and incident to any such order, or any conveyance or transfer in pursuance thereof, to be paid or raised out of the land or personal estate in respect whereof the same is made, or out of the income thereof, or to be borne and paid in such manner and by such persons as to the Court may seem just.\n\n45. Trustees of charities\n    The powers conferred by this Act as to vesting orders may be exercised for vesting any property in any trustee of a charity or society over which the Court would have jurisdiction upon proceedings duly instituted, whether the appointment of the trustee was made by instrument under a power or by the Court under its general or statutory jurisdiction.\n\n46. Orders made upon certain allegations to be conclusive evidence\n    Where a vesting order as to any property is made under this Act, or under any Act relating to insanity founded on an allegation of the personal incapacity of a trustee, or on an allegation that a trustee or the representative of a mortgagee is out of the jurisdiction of the Court or cannot be found, or that it is uncertain which of several trustees, or which of several devisees of a mortgagee was the survivor, or whether the last trustee or the representative of a mortgagee is living or dead, or on an allegation that there is no representative of a trustee or mortgagee, or on an allegation that any trustee or mortgagee has died intestate without a representative, or has died and it is not known who is his representative, or has died and it is uncertain whether he died intestate or who is his representative, the fact that the order has been so made shall be conclusive evidence of the matter so alleged in any court upon any question as to the validity of the order; but this section shall not prevent the Court from directing a reconveyance or the payment of costs occasioned by any such order if it was improperly obtained.\n\n47. Power of Court to make orders in certain cases not provided for by trust instruments, &c.\n        (1) Where in the management or administration of any property vested in trustees, any sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release, or other disposition, or any purchase, investment, acquisition, expenditure, or other transaction is, in the opinion of the Court, expedient, but the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument, if any, or by law, the Court may by order confer upon the trustees, either generally or in any particular instance, the necessary power for the purpose, upon such terms, and subject to such provisions and conditions, if any, as the Court may think fit, and may direct in what manner any money authorized to be expended, and the costs of any transaction, are to be paid or borne as between capital and income.\n        (2) The Court may rescind or vary any order made under this section, or may make any new or further order.\n        (3) An application to the Court under this section may be made by the trustees, or by any of them, or by any person beneficially interested under the trust.\n        (4) This section does not apply to trustees of a settlement for the purposes of the Settled Land Act 1884 .\n        (5) The powers conferred on the Court by this section shall extend to all property vested in trustees for charitable, religious, or public trusts or purposes, whether by or under any Act or otherwise, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Act or the trust instrument.\n\n48.

Payment into Court of money of certain persons under disability\n    Where any infant or any involuntary patient within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2013 shall be entitled, or when any unborn person or class of unborn persons would upon coming into existence become entitled, to any money payable in discharge of any property which has been made the subject of an order under this Act, the person by whom such money is payable may pay the same into Court in trust in any cause then depending concerning such money, or, if there shall be no such cause, to the credit of such infant or other persons as aforesaid; and the Court may, upon petition or summons, make such order as to the investment of such money or the payment out or distribution thereof, or as to the payment of the dividends or interest thereof, as to the Court may seem reasonable.\n\n50. Jurisdiction of Court in cases of breach of trust\n    If it appears to the Court that a trustee is or may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the passing of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the Court in the matter in which he committed such breach, then the Court may relieve the trustee, either wholly or partly, from personal liability for the same.\n\n51. Power to give judgment in absence of trustee\n    When in any cause or matter the Court is satisfied that diligent search has been made for any person who, in the character of trustee, is made a defendant or party to the cause or matter, to serve him with process of the Court or with any proceedings in the cause or matter, and that he cannot be found, the Court may hear and determine the cause or matter, and give judgment therein against that person in his character of a trustee as if he had been duly served or had entered an appearance in the cause or matter, and had also appeared by his counsel and Australian legal practitioner at the hearing, but without prejudice to any interest he may have in the matters in question in the cause or matter in any other character.\n\n52. Power to sanction sale of land or minerals separately\n        (1) When a trustee or other person is for the time being authorized to dispose of land by way of sale, exchange, or partition, the Court may sanction his so disposing of the land with an exception or reservation of any minerals, and with or without rights and powers of or incidental to the working, getting, or carrying away of the minerals, or so disposing of the minerals, with or without the said rights or powers, separately from the residue of the land.\n        (2) Any such trustee or other person, having obtained such sanction, may, unless forbidden by the instrument creating the trust or direction, without any further application to the Court, so dispose of any such land or minerals.\n        (3) This section does not derogate from any power which a trustee may have under the Settled Land Act 1884 , or otherwise.\n\n53. Power to make beneficiary indemnify for breach of trust\n    Where a trustee shall have committed a breach of trust at the instigation or request, or with the consent in writing of a beneficiary, the Court may, if it shall think fit, and notwithstanding that the beneficiary may be a married woman entitled for her separate use, whether with or without a restraint upon anticipation, make such order as to the Court shall seem just for impounding all or any part of the interest of the beneficiary in the trust estate by way of indemnity to the trustee or person claiming through him.\n\nPART VI - Miscellaneous and Supplemental\n\n54.

Trust estates not affected by trustee becoming a convict\n    Property vested in any person on any trust, or by way of mortgage, shall not, in case of that person being sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding 2 years, vest in any such administrator as may be appointed under that Act, but shall remain in the trustee or mortgagee or survive to his co-trustee or descend to his representative, as if he had not been so sentenced: Provided that this enactment shall not affect the title to the property, so far as relates to any beneficial interest therein of any such trustee or mortgagee.\n\n60.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n61.
