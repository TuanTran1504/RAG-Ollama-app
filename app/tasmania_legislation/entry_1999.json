Recording of demerit points\n                (1) If –\n                        (a) a Tasmanian court awards demerit points in respect of a traffic offence that attracts demerit points; or\n                        (b) demerit points are to be awarded following the service of a traffic infringement notice; or\n                        (c) the Registrar is notified by a driver licensing authority under a corresponding law that a person who holds a driver licence under this Act, or a person who does not hold an Australian driver licence but is a resident of Tasmania –\n                                (i) has been convicted by a court, in the jurisdiction of the corresponding law, of an offence in respect of which demerit points are prescribed in the national schedule of demerit points or the schedule of recognised interstate demerit points offences; or\n                                (ii) has committed such an offence in the jurisdiction of the corresponding law and has been dealt with under a procedure corresponding to the traffic infringement notice procedure –\n                the Registrar must record or transmit the relevant information as required in this section.\n                (2) The relevant information is –\n                        (a) the name and address of the offender; and\n                        (b) the nature of the offence and the date of its commission; and\n                        (c) whether the offence was dealt with by a court or a traffic infringement notice or a similar procedure under the law of another jurisdiction.\n                (3) Demerit points awarded by a court on conviction are not to be recorded, and information is not to be transmitted, under this section until –\n                        (a) the time for appealing against the conviction has passed; or\n                        (b) if there is an appeal – the appeal is determined, withdrawn or discontinued.\n                (4) Information is to be recorded or transmitted as follows:\n                        (a) if the person holds a driver licence under this Act (or is a resident of Tasmania who does not hold an Australian driver licence)– the Registrar must record the date of commission of the offence, and the number of demerit points awarded, in the demerit points register;\n                        (b) if the person holds an Australian driver licence issued under the corresponding law of another State or a Territory (or is a resident of another State or a Territory who does not hold an Australian driver licence) – the Registrar must, as soon as practicable, transmit the relevant information to the driver licensing authority for the relevant State or Territory.\n                (5) Demerit points are taken to have been recorded in the demerit points register on the date of commission of the offence to which they relate.\n                (6) Demerit points are to be recorded in the demerit points register even though the person who has incurred the demerit points, and against whom they are to be recorded, does not hold (or has never held) an Australian driver licence.\n                (7) For the purpose of calculating the aggregate number of demerit points recorded against the holder of a driver licence or a person who has held, but not longer holds, a driver licence, it is immaterial whether the demerit points were incurred during the currency of the licence or during a period when the person did not hold a driver licence.\n\n        24. Licence to be suspended when demerit points reach prescribed limit\n                (1) A driver licence is liable to suspension because of the accumulation of demerit points against the holder of the licence as follows:\n                        (a) a learner or provisional licence is liable to suspension if –\n                                (i) the holder of the licence has never held a full licence; and\n                                (ii) the demerit points recorded against the holder for traffic offences committed during a period of 12 months or less amount, in aggregate, to 4 or more;\n                        (b) a driver licence (whatever its type) is liable to suspension if the demerit points recorded against the holder for traffic offences committed during a period of 3 years or less amount, in aggregate, to 12 or more;\n                        (c) a full licence is liable to suspension if the demerit points recorded against the holder for traffic offences committed during a period of 12 months or less as the holder of a previous provisional licence amount, in aggregate, to 4 or more.\n                (2) If a driver licence becomes liable to suspension under subsection (1) , the Registrar must serve a notice of licence suspension on the holder of the licence stating the period of licence suspension and when the period is to commence.\n                (2A) The Registrar, by notice in writing served on the holder of the licence, may withdraw a notice of licence suspension at any time before the suspension takes effect.\n                (3) The period of suspension is –\n                        (a) for the holder of a learner or provisional licence or the holder of a full licence whose liability to suspension arises under subsection (1)(c) – 3 months (unless the person would have been liable to a longer period of licence suspension if paragraph (b) was applicable, in which case the longer period applies); or\n                        (b) in any other case as follows:\n                                (i) if the aggregate number of demerit points recorded against the holder of the driver licence when it became liable to suspension is 12 or more but not more than 15 – 3 months;\n                                (ii) if the aggregate number of demerit points recorded against the holder of the driver licence when it became liable to suspension is 16 or more but not more than 19 – 4 months;\n                                (iii) if the aggregate number of demerit points recorded against the holder of the driver licence when it became liable to suspension is 20 or more – 5 months.\n                (4) Unless the driver licence is a learner licence or a provisional licence, the holder of the licence may, as an alternative to undergoing the licence suspension under this section, give the Registrar a written undertaking to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months from the date on which the licence suspension would otherwise have taken effect.\n                (5) The undertaking must be given in the form required by the Registrar –\n                        (a) within 21 days from the date of service of the notice of licence suspension; or\n                        (b) at a later time allowed by the Registrar in a particular case.\n                (6) If –\n                        (a) the holder of a driver licence gives an undertaking to be of good behaviour as required under this section; and\n                        (b) during the period to which the undertaking relates commits an offence (or offences) in respect of which 2 or more demerit points (in aggregate) are recorded –\n                the Registrar must serve a further notice of licence suspension on the holder of the licence (whether or not the period of good behaviour has expired) for twice the period of licence suspension to which the person was liable when the first notice of licence suspension was served, and the person is not entitled to give a further undertaking under subsection (4) as an alternative to undergoing the licence suspension.\n                (7) A period of licence suspension under this section commences –\n                        (a) on such day following the 21 day period after the relevant notice of licence suspension is served as the Registrar determines and specifies in that notice; or\n                        (b) if the holder of the licence is not subject to a current period of licence suspension, disqualification from driving or ineligibility to hold a driver licence and submits to the licence suspension on an earlier day by returning the licence to the Registrar, on that earlier day.\n                (8) Subject to subsection (9) , when a period of licence suspension commences, or an undertaking to be of good behaviour is given, under this section, the demerit points recorded in the register, as at the date of the notice of licence suspension, against the person to whom the notice is given are taken to be deleted.\n                (9) Subsection (8) is subject to the following qualifications:\n                        (a) demerit points that had not been recorded at the date of the notice of licence suspension (whether incurred before or after that date) are not taken to be deleted;\n                        (b) if the notice of licence suspension is given because of the accumulation of demerit points during a period for which the person liable to the licence suspension has undertaken to be of good behaviour, demerit points incurred after the date of the first notice of licence suspension are not taken to be deleted.\n                (10) If a driver licence would, but for this subsection, expire during the course of a period of licence suspension imposed under this section, the term of the licence is extended by this subsection until the end of the period of suspension.\n                (11) If a driver licence that is liable to suspension under this section is due to expire during a period of disqualification from driving imposed for an excessive speeding offence –\n                        (a) the holder of the licence may, notwithstanding the disqualification, apply for the renewal of the licence; and\n                        (b) the renewal, if granted, is not capable of taking effect before the expiration of the period of disqualification.\n\n        25. Period of ineligibility for unlicensed drivers\n                (1) A person who does not hold a current driver licence is liable to a period of ineligibility to hold a driver licence because of the accumulation of demerit points as follows:\n                        (a) if –\n                                (i) the person has never held a full licence and has not progressed beyond the status of a provisional driver; and\n                                (ii) the demerit points recorded against the person for traffic offences committed during a period of 12 months or less amount, in aggregate, to 4 or more;\n                        (b) whether or not the person has ever held a full licence – if the demerit points recorded against the person for traffic offences committed during a period of 3 years or less amount, in aggregate, to 12 or more.\n                (1A) Subsection (1)(a) does not apply to a person who has held a provisional licence for the required period to be eligible to obtain a full licence but has never held a full licence.\n                (2) If a person becomes liable to a period of ineligibility under subsection (1) , the Registrar must serve a notice of ineligibility stating the period of ineligibility and when the period is to commence.\n                (3) The period of ineligibility is –\n                        (a) for a person who has never held a full licence and has not progressed beyond the status of a provisional driver – 3 months (unless the person would have been liable to a longer period of ineligibility if paragraph (b) was applicable, in which case the longer period applies); or\n                        (b) in any other case as follows:\n                                (i) if the aggregate number of demerit points recorded against the person when he or she became liable to the period of ineligibility is 12 or more but not more than 15 – 3 months;\n                                (ii) if the aggregate number of demerit points recorded against the person when he or she became liable to the period of ineligibility is 16 or more but not more than 19 – 4 months;\n                                (iii) if the aggregate number of demerit points recorded against the person when he or she became liable to the period of ineligibility is 20 or more – 5 months.\n                (4) A period of ineligibility under this section commences on such day as the Registrar determines and specifies in the relevant notice of ineligibility.\n                (5) Before a period of ineligibility commences, the person on whom the notice of ineligibility was served may apply for the renewal of his or her last driver licence if –\n                        (a) the person would, apart from the ineligibility resulting from the accumulation of demerit points, be entitled to renewal of the licence; and\n                        (b) the person –\n                                (i) has, at some time in the past, held a full licence (whether or not his or her last licence was a full licence) and has not reverted to the status of a learner driver or, if so, has progressed beyond that status; or\n                                (ii) has held a provisional licence for the required period to be eligible to obtain a full licence but has never held a full licence.\n                (6) The application for renewal may be accompanied by a written undertaking, in the form required by the Registrar, to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months from the date on which the period of ineligibility would otherwise have taken effect.\n                (7) If a person who makes an application for renewal of a driver licence under subsection (5) would, apart from the ineligibility, be entitled to the renewal, the Registrar must renew the licence and, in that event –\n                        (a) if the application was not accompanied by a written undertaking, in the form required by the Registrar, to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months – the licence will, as from the date of its renewal, be under suspension as if –\n                                (i) the notice of ineligibility had been a notice of licence suspension under section 24 ; and\n                                (ii) the person on whom the notice was served had been, at the time of service, the holder of a current driver licence; and\n                                (iii) the period of the licence suspension had been the same as the period of ineligibility and had commenced at the date of renewal of the licence; or\n                        (b) if the application was accompanied by such an undertaking – the licence will not be under suspension on its renewal, but section 24 applies as if –\n                                (i) the notice of ineligibility had been a notice of licence suspension under section 24 ; and\n                                (ii) the person on whom the notice was served had been, at the time of service, the holder of a current driver licence; and\n                                (iii) the period of the licence suspension had been the same as the period of ineligibility and had commenced at the date of renewal of the licence; and\n                                (iv) the undertaking were an undertaking given under section 24 , to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months from the date of renewal of the licence, as an alternative to undergoing the period of licence suspension.\n                (8) Subject to subsection (9) , when a period of ineligibility or licence suspension commences, or an undertaking to be of good behaviour is given, under this section, the demerit points recorded in the register, as at the date of the notice of ineligibility, against the person to whom the notice is given are taken to be deleted.\n                (9) Demerit points that had not been recorded at the date of the notice of ineligibility (whether incurred before or after that date) are not taken to be deleted.\n                (10) Once a period of ineligibility imposed under this section has commenced –\n                        (a) the person subject to the ineligibility cannot apply for, or be issued with, a driver licence until the end of the period of ineligibility;
