Attempts\n        (1) Where, upon the hearing of a complaint for a simple offence, the complete commission of the offence charged is not proved but the evidence establishes that the defendant attempted to commit that offence, he may be convicted of such an attempt.\n        (2) An attempt to commit a simple offence is an act or omission done or made with intent to commit that offence, and forming part of a series of events which if it were not interrupted would constitute the actual commission of the offence.\n        (3) The offence of attempting to commit a simple offence may be committed, although the offender voluntarily desists from the actual commission of the simple offence itself, and whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit that simple offence or not.\n        (4) The point at which a series of events as mentioned in subsection (2) begins depends upon the circumstances of each particular case.\n        (5) Whether an act or omission is, or is not, too remote to constitute an attempt to commit a simple offence is a question of law.\n        (6) Where, upon the hearing of a complaint for an attempt to commit a simple offence, the evidence establishes that the defendant has completed the commission of the simple offence, he may be convicted of the simple offence.\n        (7) Where a person has been convicted of an attempt to commit a simple offence, he is not liable to be tried for the simple offence of which he was so convicted of having attempted to commit.\n\n74A.

Commitment in other cases\n    When an order is not for the payment of money, but for the doing of some other act, and directs that in case of the defendant's neglect or refusal to do that act he shall be imprisoned with or without hard labour, then, if the defendant neglects or refuses to do the act, a justice may issue his warrant of commitment of the defendant to gaol, there to be imprisoned, with or without hard labour, as the case may be, for such time as the justice making the order directs.\n\n88.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n89.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n90.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n91.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n92.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n92A.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n92B.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n92C.\n. . . . . . . .\n\nPART X - Surety of the Peace\n\n93. Power to require surety\n        (1) A justice may require surety of a person when he is required to do so by a person who –\n                (a) deposes on oath that the person from whom surety is sought will –\n                        (i) do him, his wife or child, or a person under his care or charge bodily harm;\n                        (ii) cause him or any of them to be unlawfully imprisoned;\n                        (iii) burn or injure his house; or\n                        (iv) procure another person to do any of those things –\n                and that he does not require it out of malice or for vexation; and\n                (b) satisfies the justice by the evidence of himself or of others that he has just cause for his fear because the person of whom surety is sought has –\n                        (i) threatened so to do; or\n                        (ii) lain in wait for that purpose.\n        (2) A justice may require surety of a person when he is –\n                (a) required so to do by any person who gives him satisfactory evidence on oath that the person from whom surety is sought has –\n                        (i) used provoking or insulting language;\n                        (ii) exhibited an offensive writing or object; or\n                        (iii) done an offensive act to or in the presence of the party complaining, for the purpose of annoyance and provocation, or publicly and to the common annoyance of the Sovereign's subjects; and\n                (b) of opinion that such conduct is likely to be repeated and may tend to provoke a breach of the peace.\n        (3) A justice may require surety of a person when he is –\n                (a) satisfied by evidence that the person from whom surety is sought has threatened to do, or to procure some other person to do, any act which would –\n                        (i) if done, be punishable as an offence; and\n                        (ii) be calculated to cause serious injury to the complainant, or any person in his care or charge, or to any property of the complainant or such person; and\n                (b) of opinion that there is just cause for fear that the person so threatening will, if not prevented, carry his threat into execution.\n        (4) A justice may require surety of a person when he is satisfied by evidence that the person from whom surety is sought –\n                (a) has either by word of mouth or letter, challenged another person to fight;\n                (b) has knowingly been the messenger of any such challenge from another;\n                (c) has accepted or intends to accept any such challenge; or\n                (d) intends to fight or to be present aiding or abetting at any such fight or breach of the peace.\n        (5) A justice may require surety of a person where that person has by word or writing, incited or attempted to incite another person to take part in a riot, or to commit any other breach of the peace.\n        (6) Where a justice is by this section empowered to require surety of a person, he may call on him to enter into recognizance to the Sovereign with or without sureties, as he thinks fit, for keeping the peace.\n\n94. How application for surety of the peace is to be made\n        (1) Where a person applies to a justice to have any other person bound over to keep the peace, the application shall be by way of complaint, to be verified by the oath of the applicant.\n        (2) In the complaint the facts upon which the complainant relies in support of his application shall be fully set forth; and, if any of such facts be not within the personal knowledge of the complainant, they shall, if the justice so require, be verified by the corroborative oath of some other person.\n        (3) If the justice receiving the complaint, and considering the matter thereof, sees sufficient cause so to do, he shall thereupon issue his warrant, requiring that the person against whom the complaint is made be apprehended and brought before him, or some other justice or justices, to answer to the complaint, and to be further dealt with according to law.\n        (4) If the justice is of opinion that the complainant has cause for his application, but that no person or property is in immediate danger from the defendant, he may, if he thinks fit, issue his summons in the first instance to compel the appearance of the defendant.\n\n95. How application is to be heard\n        (1) A complaint for surety of the peace shall be heard and determined in open court, and in the same manner as nearly as a complaint for a simple offence.\n        (2) Upon the appearance of the person from whom surety is sought, the complaint shall be read over to him, and, if he has no cause to allege why he should not be bound over to keep the peace, the justice then present may thereupon require him to enter into recognizance accordingly.\n        (3) If he has any such cause to allege, he may require the complainant or his witnesses to be examined upon oath, and cross-examine them, and may by way of defence adduce evidence to explain, or controvert the truth of, the facts relied upon by the complainant in support of his application, or to show that the complaint is made for malice only or vexation.\n\n96. Complaint to be dismissed if preferred from malice only and without just cause of fear\n    If the justice hearing the complaint is of opinion that the complainant has no just cause of fear, or that the complaint has been made out of malice or for vexation, and without just cause of fear, he shall dismiss the case, and may order the complainant to pay to the defendant such costs as to him shall seem just and reasonable in that behalf.\n\n97. If complaint reasonable defendant to be required to give security\n        (1) If the justice hearing the complaint considers that there are good grounds so to do, he may order the defendant to enter with one or more sureties as to him seems meet into a recognizance to the Queen in such sum as the justice deems sufficient, conditioned that the defendant do keep the peace –\n                (a) towards the complainant;\n                (b) towards Her Majesty and all her liege people; or\n                (c) towards Her Majesty and all her liege people, and especially towards the complainant –\n        for a time to be fixed by the order not exceeding 2 years from the date of the recognizance.\n        (2) A recognizance for the purposes of this Part may be entered into by the principal or any sureties thereto before a justice, and it is not necessary for all the parties to the recognizance to be present at the same time.\n\n98. Power of justice to order defendant to pay costs\n        (1) The costs of the proceedings for surety of the peace shall be paid in the first instance by the complainant; but the justice may, if he thinks fit, order that the defendant pay to the complainant such costs as he deems reasonable.\n        (2) Payment of costs which the justice may order to be paid by either party to the other shall be enforced in like manner as costs ordered to be paid under Part IX .\n\n99. Power of justice to commit defendant until he enters into the required recognizance\n        (1) If the defendant refuses or neglects to enter into a recognizance when so required or is unable to find sufficient sureties to the satisfaction of the justice requiring them, the justice may issue his warrant, commanding that the defendant be taken to a gaol, there to be kept until he enters into the recognizance.\n        (2) A person shall not be detained in prison under this section for a longer period than he would have been bound under recognizance of the peace if he had entered into the recognizance upon the day of the making of the order.\n\n100. Right of complainant to require defendant to be bound over to keep the peace\n    Where a complaint is laid against a person for an assault punishable summarily, the complainant may, in the same complaint require that the defendant be bound over to keep the peace.\n\n101. Power to require convicted persons to give sureties of the peace in addition to or in lieu of punishment\n    Wherever, upon the hearing of any complaint for an offence punishable summarily, it appears to the justices, by the evidence, that the defendant has used threats, or done an act for which he might be required to enter into recognizance of the peace, they may, if they think fit, require the defendant to enter into such a recognizance, either in addition to or in lieu of the punishment to which he is liable upon conviction of the offence, and whether the complainant has required sureties of the peace against the defendant or not.\n\n102. Power of justices, upon sufficient cause, to require persons to give sureties of the peace where no complaint is made\n    When a person within the view or hearing of a justice uses a threat or other language, or does an act, on proof of which he might on complaint made be required to enter into recognizance of the peace, the justice may forthwith, and without further proof, require that person to enter into such recognizance of the peace as the justice deems sufficient, and in default of his doing may commit him to prison as provided in section 99 .\n\n103. Power to release persons imprisoned in default of finding sureties if complainant dies\n    If the person upon whose complaint a justice has required the defendant to find surety of the peace dies, and the defendant is then in prison in default of giving surety, the justice who made the order, if he thinks fit, may order the defendant to be released from custody without giving surety.\n\n104. Recognizances not to be discharged by release from complainant\n    No person who has been required to enter into recognizance of the peace is discharged therefrom by a release from the complainant, and if in custody in default of entering into the recognizance, he is not entitled to be liberated in consequence of any such release.\n\n105.

Right of justices to show cause\n        (1) Where a notice to review is served on the clerk to the justices pursuant to section 107 (3) (b) (ii) , the justices may make and file in the Supreme Court without fee an affidavit setting forth –\n                (a) the grounds of the order sought to be reviewed; and\n                (b) any facts that they consider to have a material bearing on the question at issue.\n        (2) An affidavit under this section may be sworn before a justice, and sent by post to the Registrar of the Supreme Court for filing.\n        (3) Where an affidavit is filed under this section, the court shall, before determining the matter so as to overrule, set aside, or vary the act or order of the justices, take into consideration the matters set forth in the affidavit, although no counsel appears on behalf of the justices.\n\n113. Affidavits\n        (1) On the hearing of a motion to review, a party may not use an affidavit that has not been filed and a copy thereof delivered to every other party at least 48 hours before the motion is returnable, except by leave of the court, which may be granted on terms as to costs or otherwise.\n        (2) This section does not apply to affidavits filed by justices under section 112 .\n\nDivision 2 - Appeals to, and review by, magistrates\n\n113A.

Review by magistrate\n        (1) Subject to compliance with the provisions of the rules of court, a person who is aggrieved by an order made by a court of petty sessions (other than one constituted by a magistrate) in relation to an offence or a breach of duty may apply to a magistrate to review that order.\n        (2) On the hearing of an application under this section, the magistrate may –\n                (a) if he is of opinion that the matter received by him from the original court is insufficient to enable him to review the order; or\n                (b) with the consent of the party who was the defendant in the original proceedings –\n        proceed as if the defendant was then and there appearing before him on the first hearing of the relevant complaint and had pleaded guilty to the matter of complaint contained therein.\n        (3) Upon the hearing of an application under this section –\n                (a) the magistrate may exercise any of the powers contained in paragraphs (a) , (b) , (f) , and (g) of section 110 (2) ; and\n                (b) the provisions of section 111 (7) apply, with the necessary modifications, to the hearing of an application under this section.\n        (3A) A magistrate, on the hearing of an application under this section in relation to an order imposing a sentence on a person in relation to a matter, may (whether the person or the prosecutor applied under subsection (1) for the review) take into account any matter relevant to sentencing that has occurred between when the order to which the reviews relates was made and when the magistrate reviews the order.\n        (3B) Despite subsection (3A) , a magistrate, in exercising in relation to an order in respect of a person a power under subsection (3) , the effect of the exercise of which is that the person is being sentenced again for an offence, must not take into account any element of double jeopardy so as to impose a less severe sentence than the magistrate would otherwise consider appropriate.\n        (4) The receipt by an original court of an application under this section operates as a suspension ab initio of the order to be reviewed, except in so far as that order imposes a term of imprisonment on a person referred to in the order.\n        (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (4) , a justice may grant bail to a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the order for any period not exceeding 28 days if, in the opinion of the justice, adequate measures can be taken to secure the attendance of that person at the hearing of the application.\n\nDivision 3 - Stated case\n\n114.
