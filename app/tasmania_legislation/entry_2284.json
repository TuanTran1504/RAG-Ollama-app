Prisoner subject to more than one non-parole period or other minimum term\n        (1) In this section –\n            designated sentence – see subsection (1A) ;\n            minimum term, in relation to a designated sentence, means –\n                    (a) in the case of a sentence to which a non-parole period is applicable, that non-parole period; or\n                    (b) in any other case, the sentence itself.\n        (1A) For the purposes of this section, a sentence imposed on a person is a designated sentence if, subject to subsection (6) , the sentence is a sentence of imprisonment –\n                (a) to which a non-parole period is applicable; or\n                (b) to which an order under section 17(2)(a) of the Sentencing Act 1997 is applicable; or\n                (c) in respect of which the person is ineligible for parole by operation of section 17(3A) of the Sentencing Act 1997 .\n        (2) If, at any time, a person is subject to 2 or more designated sentences –\n                (a) the minimum terms relating to those designated sentences, subject to subsections (3) and (4) , are to be cumulative upon, or concurrent with, each other in like manner as the sentences to which they relate; and\n                (b) the completion by a person of the non-parole period applicable to a sentence to which the person is subject is not to be taken into account for the purposes of section 70 if, at the time of completion of that non-parole period, the person has not completed the minimum term relating to any other designated sentence to which the person is subject.\n        (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) , if, at any time, a person is subject to 2 or more sentences that are to be served concurrently, being sentences to each of which, but for this subsection, a non-parole period would be applicable under section 68 , those sentences are to be taken to be collectively subject to a single non-parole period.\n        (4) The single non-parole period referred to in subsection (3) is to be ascertained in accordance with section 68 as if the sentences to which the person is subject comprised a single sentence of imprisonment for a period equal to the total period of imprisonment to which the person is sentenced as a result of those sentences being served concurrently.\n        (5) If, under subsection (2) , the minimum term in relation to a designated sentence is cumulative upon the minimum term in relation to another such sentence, the later minimum term is to be taken to commence upon the expiration of the earlier minimum term, notwithstanding that the earlier sentence has not been completed.\n        (6) If a person becomes eligible for release on parole under this Act while the person is subject to a designated sentence –\n                (a) each designated sentence to which the person is subject ceases to be a designated sentence, for the purposes of this section, if –\n                        (i) the person is subject to the designated sentence on the date on which the person becomes so eligible for release (the relevant date); and\n                        (ii) the person has completed the minimum term for that designated sentence; and\n                (b) a minimum term for a sentence referred to in paragraph (a) is not to be taken into account, under this section, in respect of a sentence that is imposed on the person on or after the relevant date.\n        (7) For the avoidance of doubt, subsection (6) –\n                (a) may apply in respect of a person on one or more occasions; and\n                (b) applies to a designated sentence imposed on a person before the day on which the Corrections Amendment Act 2022 commences (the commencement day) if –\n                        (i) the person –\n                                (A) is eligible for release on parole in respect of the sentence before the commencement day; and\n                                (B) is on parole, or remains eligible for parole, in respect of the sentence on the commencement day; or\n                        (ii) the person becomes eligible for release on parole in respect of the sentence on or after the commencement day.\n        (8) If –\n                (a) a sentence (the previous sentence) imposed on a person ceases to be a designated sentence by virtue of subsection (6) ; and\n                (b) a designated sentence (the new designated sentence) is imposed on the person while the person is still subject to the previous sentence; and\n                (c) at the time at which the new designated sentence is imposed on the person, the person is not subject to any other designated sentences –\n            the minimum term for the new designated sentence is taken to commence –\n                (d) on the day on which the new designated sentence is imposed on the person; or\n                (e) on such other day as may be specified, in respect of the minimum term, by the court imposing the new designated sentence.\n\n72.

or\n                (c) refuse to release the prisoner on parole.\n        (4) In determining whether or not a prisoner should be released on parole, the Board is to take into consideration –\n                (a) the likelihood of the prisoner re-offending; and\n                (b) the protection of the public; and\n                (c) the rehabilitation of the prisoner; and\n                (d) any remarks made by the court in passing sentence; and\n                (e) the likelihood of the prisoner complying with the conditions;

Period of parole\n    The period of parole ordered by the Board under section 72 applies to the release of a prisoner notwithstanding that the total of that period and the period of the sentence of imprisonment that he or she has already served at the time of his or her release exceeds the full term of that sentence.\n\n76. Sentences for offences committed during release on parole\n        (1) If a prisoner is sentenced to imprisonment for an offence committed during the period of his or her release on parole, that sentence is, subject to subsection (2) , to be cumulative on the remainder of the sentence in respect of which the prisoner was released on parole.\n        (2) If the court is of the opinion that special circumstances make it desirable to do so, it may order that the whole or part of the sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed during the period of a prisoners release on parole is to be concurrent with the remainder of the sentence in respect of which the prisoner was released on parole.\n\n77. Effect of parole orders\n        (1) A parole order is sufficient authority to the Director and any person having the custody or control of the prisoner to whom the order applies to release the prisoner in accordance with the terms of the order.\n        (2) A prisoner who is released under a parole order is, while on parole, under the supervision of a probation officer.\n        (3) A prisoner who is released under a parole order must, while on parole, comply with any terms and conditions to which the order is subject and with such requirements as may be made of the prisoner by the probation officer.\n        (4) Notwithstanding subsection (2) , the Board may –\n                (a) in circumstances that it considers exceptional, direct that a prisoner who is released under a parole order is not required to be under the supervision of a probation officer; or\n                (b) if it considers that it is unreasonable or unnecessary for a prisoner released under a parole order to be under the supervision of a probation officer for the whole of the period the prisoner is on parole, direct that the prisoner so released is required to be under the supervision of a probation officer only for such part of that period as the Board specifies in its direction.\n\n78.
