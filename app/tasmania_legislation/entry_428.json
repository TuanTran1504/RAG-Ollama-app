Special federal matters: Commonwealth authorities or officers acting under the laws of States\n        (1) This section applies to a proceeding (in this section referred to as the \"federal matter proceeding\") if –\n                (a) a matter for determination in the proceeding is covered by paragraph (c) or (e) of the definition of \"special federal matter\" in section 3(1) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 of the Commonwealth; and\n                (b) the matter for determination in the proceeding involves or relates to the exercise, or purported or proposed exercise, of functions or powers conferred on a Commonwealth authority, or officer of the Commonwealth, by an enactment (in this subsection referred to as \"the State enactment\") referred to in paragraph (ca) or (cb) of the definition of \"enactment\" in section 3(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 of the Commonwealth; and\n                (c) the matter for determination in the proceeding arises out of, or relates to, another proceeding (in this section referred to as the \"State matter proceeding\") pending in any court of this State –\n                        (i) that arises, or a substantial part of which arises, under the State enactment or a corresponding enactment of another State; and\n                        (ii) none of the matters for determination in which are covered by paragraph (c) or (e) of the definition of \"special federal matter\" in section 3(1) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 of the Commonwealth –\n                regardless of which proceeding was commenced first.\n        (2) If –\n                (a) the federal matter proceeding is pending in the Federal Court or the Family Court; and\n                (b) having regard to the interests of justice, including the desirability of related proceedings being heard in the same jurisdiction, the Federal Court or the Family Court considers it appropriate to transfer the proceeding to the Supreme Court –\n        the Federal Court or the Family Court may transfer the proceeding to the Supreme Court and section 5(4) does not apply to the federal matter proceeding.\n        (3) If –\n                (a) the federal matter proceeding is pending in the Supreme Court; and\n                (b) the State matter proceeding is pending in any court of this State –\n        neither section 5(1) nor section 6 applies to require the Supreme Court to transfer the federal matter proceeding to the Federal Court or the Family Court.\n        (4) The Supreme Court may transfer the federal matter proceeding if it considers that to be appropriate, having regard to the interests of justice, including the desirability of related proceedings being heard in the same jurisdiction.\n        (5) Nothing in this section confers on a court jurisdiction that the court would not otherwise have.\n        (6) The fact that references in this section to the interests of justice include the desirability of related proceedings being heard in the same jurisdiction does not of itself mean that references to the interests of justice elsewhere in this Act do not include that matter.\n        (7) In this section –\n            Commonwealth authority means an authority or other body (whether incorporated or not) that is established or continued in existence by or under an Act of the Commonwealth;\n            officer of the Commonwealth has the same meaning as in section 75(v) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth.\n\n7.

Conduct of proceedings\n        (1) Where it appears to a court that the court will, or will be likely to, in determining a matter for determination in a proceeding, be exercising jurisdiction conferred by this Act or by a law of the Commonwealth or a State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction –\n                (a) subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) , the court shall, in determining that matter, apply the law in force in the State or Territory in which the court is sitting (including choice of law rules);\n                (b) subject to paragraph (c) , if that matter is a right of action arising under a written law of another State or Territory, the court shall, in determining that matter, apply the written and unwritten law of that other State or Territory; and\n                (c) the rules of evidence and procedure to be applied in dealing with that matter shall be such as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances, being rules that are applied in a superior court in Australia or in an external Territory.\n        (2) . . . . . . . .\n        (3) Where a proceeding is transferred or removed to a court (in this subsection referred to as the \"transferee court\") from another court (in this subsection referred to as the \"transferor court\"), the transferee court shall deal with the proceeding as if, subject to any order of the transferee court, the steps that had been taken for the purposes of the proceeding in the transferor court (including the making of an order), or similar steps, had been taken in the transferee court.\n\n12.

Construction of Act to be subject to legislative power of State\n    This Act shall be read and construed so as not to exceed the legislative power of the State, to the intent that if this Act would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be valid to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.\n\n16.

Transitional provision\n    Despite the amendments made to this Act by the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Amendment Act 1992 , this Act as in force immediately before the commencement of those amendments continues to apply in relation to a proceeding pending in a court to which section 6 applied before that commencement."
