Emergency application\n    For the purposes of these regulations, an application is an emergency application –\n            (a) if –\n                    (i) a permit has been issued under section 12 or 14 of the Living Marine Resources Management Act 1995 in respect of all or part of the activity to which the application relates; and\n                    (ii) the permit authorises, for a period specified in the permit, the keeping of finfish in the area of State waters to which the application relates; and\n                    (iii) the Director is satisfied that an environmental licence in relation to the application should be issued on urgency; or\n            (b) if there is an emergency order in relation to the lease area to which the application relates; or\n            (c) if there is an emergency plan in relation to the lease area to which the application relates.\n\n5. Special penalty\n        (1) For the purposes of section 42C(5)(a) of the Act, the amount of the special penalty to be imposed on a person who commits an offence, against section 42C(4) of the Act, constituted by contravening a condition of an environmental licence that limits the rate of dissolved nitrogen being produced, or emitted, in the course of the conduct of an activity under the licence, is a fine of 1 000 penalty units for each tonne of dissolved nitrogen that exceeds that rate.\n        (2) For the purposes of subregulation (1) , if the amount of dissolved nitrogen is not a whole number of tonnes, the special penalty is to be calculated on a pro rata basis.\n\n6. Period in which application for renewal of licence to be made\n    For the purposes of section 42S(2) of the Act, the number of days, before the day on which the licence expires, is prescribed to be 60.\n\n7.
