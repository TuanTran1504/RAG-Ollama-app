Action against tenant for life\n    Where any person has any rent in arrear or due upon any lease or demise for life or lives he may bring an action for such arrears of rent in the same manner as he might have done in case such rent were due and reserved upon a lease for years.\n\n8.

Second distress if first not sufficient\n    In all cases where the value of the cattle or goods or chattels distrained is found not to be of the value of the arrears distrained for, the party to whom such arrears were due, his executors or administrators may distrain again for the residue of the said arrears.\n\n37. Avowry without naming tenant\n    Whenever any lands, tenements, and other hereditaments are held of any person by any rents, if the landlord of whom any such lands, tenements, or hereditaments are so held, distrain upon the same for any such rents and replevin thereof is sued, the landlord may avow or his bailiff or servant may take cognizance or justify for taking of the said distresses, without naming any person certain to be tenant of the same and without making any avowry, justification, or cognizance upon any person certain.\n\n38. How defendant may avow in replevin\n    All defendants in replevin may avow and make cognizance generally that the plaintiff in replevin or other tenant of the lands and tenements whereon such distress was made, enjoyed the same under a grant or demise at such a certain rent during the time wherein the rent distrained for accrued, which rent was then and still remains due, or that the place where the distress was taken was parcel of such tenements, without further setting forth the grant, tenure, demise, or title of such landlord.\n\n39. Seizure and sale of goods fraudulently removed\n    In case any tenant for life or lives, term of years, at will, sufferance, or otherwise, of any messuages, lands, tenements, or hereditaments upon the demise or holding whereof any rent is or shall be reserved or made payable, shall fraudulently or clandestinely convey away or carry off or from such premises his goods or chattels to prevent the landlord from distraining the same for arrears of rent so reserved or made payable, then such landlord or any person by him for that purpose lawfully empowered, within the space of 30 days next ensuing such conveying away or carrying off such goods and chattels, may take and seize such goods and chattels wherever the same are found, as a distress for the said arrears of rent; and the same may sell or otherwise dispose of in such manner as if the said goods and chattels had actually been distrained by such landlord in and upon such premises for such arrears of rent.\n\n40.
