Unfitness to stand trial\n        (1) A person is unfit to stand trial for an offence if, because the person's mental processes are disordered or impaired or for any other reason, the person is –\n                (a) unable to understand the nature of the charge; or\n                (b) unable to plead to the charge or to exercise the right of challenge; or\n                (c) unable to understand the nature of the proceedings; or\n                (d) unable to follow the course of the proceedings; or\n                (e) unable to make a defence or answer the charge.\n        (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(e) , a person is not unfit to be tried if the only reason that the person is unable to make a defence or answer a charge is that he or she is suffering from memory loss.\n\n9. Presumption of fitness to stand trial and standard of proof\n        (1) A person's fitness to stand trial is to be presumed unless it is established, on an investigation under this Part, that the person is unfit to stand trial.\n        (2) The question of a person's unfitness to stand trial is to be determined on the balance of probabilities.\n\n10. Reservation of question of fitness to stand trial\n        (1) A court before which a person is charged with an offence may, on the application of the prosecutor, the defendant or on its own initiative, reserve the question of the defendant's fitness to stand trial for investigation under this Part.\n        (2) If, at preliminary proceedings for an indictable offence, the question of a defendant's fitness to stand trial arises –\n                (a) the question is to be reserved for determination by the Supreme Court; and\n                (b) after the question is so determined –\n                        (i) the preliminary proceedings are to be completed in accordance with the relevant criminal procedures; and\n                        (ii) if appropriate, the Supreme Court may return the preliminary proceedings to the relevant court for completion.\n        (3) If, after a trial begins, the court of trial decides that the question of the defendant's fitness to stand trial should be investigated, the court may adjourn or discontinue the trial and proceed, subject to this Part, with the investigation.\n        (4) Nothing in this section prevents the question of a defendant's fitness to stand trial from being raised more than once in the same proceedings.\n        (5) A court must not conduct an investigation into a defendant's fitness to stand trial unless it appears to the court that there is a real and substantial question as to his or her fitness to stand trial.\n\n11. Procedure on investigation\n        (1) On an investigation into a defendant's fitness to stand trial, a court –\n                (a) must hear any relevant admissible and probative evidence and representations put to the court by the prosecutor or the defendant; and\n                (b) may call evidence on its own initiative; and\n                (c) may require the defendant to undergo an examination by a psychiatrist or other appropriate expert and require the results of the examination to be reported to the court.\n        (2) At an investigation, the defendant is entitled to be legally represented.\n\n12. Investigation by Supreme Court into fitness to stand trial\n        (1) In the case of proceedings in the Supreme Court, the question whether a defendant is fit to stand trial must be determined by a jury.\n        (2) The application of the Juries Act 2003 extends to the constitution and proceedings of a jury for the purposes of this section.\n        (3) Each juror chosen under this section must –\n                (a) take an oath in the form specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1 ; or\n                (b) make an affirmation in the form specified in Part 2 of Schedule 1 .\n        (4) If a jury determines that the defendant is unfit to stand trial, it must also determine whether or not the defendant is likely to become fit to stand trial during the next 12 months.\n\n13. Finding that defendant is not unfit to stand trial\n        (1) If an investigation is completed before a jury is empanelled for the purposes of a trial and the court does not find that the defendant is unfit to stand trial, the court must call on the defendant to plead to the charge and, if he or she does not do so, must enter a plea of not guilty.\n        (2) If an investigation is completed after a jury is empanelled for the purposes of a trial and the court does not find that the defendant is unfit to stand trial, the court must resume the proceedings in accordance with appropriate criminal procedures.\n\n14. Finding that defendant is not fit to stand trial\n        (1) If, on an investigation, a court finds that the defendant is unfit to stand trial or records a finding to that effect under section 19 , the court must determine whether or not the defendant is likely to become fit to stand trial during the next 12 months.\n        (2) If the court determines that the defendant is likely to become fit to stand trial during the next 12 months, the court must adjourn the proceedings for a period not exceeding 12 months and discharge any jury empanelled for the purposes of the trial.\n        (3) If, after the adjournment, the court is of the opinion that the grounds on which the investigation was thought to be necessary no longer exist, the court may decide not to proceed with the investigation.\n        (4) Where the court decides not to proceed with the investigation, the court must call on the defendant to plead to the charge and, if he or she does not do so, must enter a plea of not guilty.\n        (5) In the case of a trial in the Supreme Court, a decision under subsection (3) is to be made without further proceedings before a jury.\n\n15. Special hearings\n        (1) A court must proceed to hold a special hearing if –\n                (a) the court determines that the defendant is not likely to become fit to stand trial within 12 months; or\n                (b) the defendant does not become fit to stand trial within 12 months after the determination referred to in section 14(2) .\n        (2) The purpose of the special hearing is to determine whether, despite the unfitness of the defendant to stand trial, on the limited evidence available the defendant is not guilty of the offence.\n        (3) In the case of proceedings in the Supreme Court, the question whether a defendant is not guilty of the offence must be determined by a jury.\n        (4) The application of the Juries Act 2003 extends to the constitution and proceedings of a jury for the purposes of this section.\n\n16. Procedures at special hearings\n        (1) A special hearing is to be conducted so that the onus of proof and standard of proof are the same as in a trial of criminal proceedings and in other respects as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings.\n        (2) The fact that the person has been found to be unfit to stand trial is taken not to be an impediment to his or her representation.\n        (3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) , at a special hearing –\n                (a) the defendant is taken to have pleaded not guilty to the offence; and\n                (b) the defendant's legal representative may exercise the defendant's rights to challenge jurors or the jury; and\n                (c) the defendant may raise any defence that could be properly raised as if the special hearing were an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings; and\n                (d) the defendant is entitled to give evidence.\n\n17. Findings at special hearings\n    The following findings are available to a court at a special hearing:\n            (a) not guilty of the offence charged or of any offence available as an alternative;\n            (b) . . . . . . . .\n            (c) not guilty of the offence charged on the ground of insanity or a finding to the same effect;\n            (d) a finding cannot be made that the defendant is not guilty of the offence charged or any offence available as an alternative.\n\n18. Effect of findings\n        (1) A defendant who is found not guilty of an offence at a special hearing is taken to have been found not guilty at an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings.\n        (2) If a defendant is found not guilty of the offence charged on the ground of insanity or on a finding being made to that effect, or a finding cannot be made that the defendant is not guilty of an offence, the court is to –\n                (a) make a restriction order; or\n                (b) release the defendant and make a supervision order; or\n                (c) make a treatment order; or\n                (d) . . . . . . . .\n                (e) release the defendant on such conditions as the court considers appropriate; or\n                (f) release the defendant unconditionally.\n        (3) Despite subsection (2) , only the Supreme Court may make a restriction order or supervision order under that subsection.\n        (4) A treatment order made under subsection (2)(c) , whether before or after the commencement of the Crimes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2016, is taken to have been made under Division 2 of Part 3 of Chapter 2 of the Mental Health Act 2013 .\n\n19. When investigation into fitness during trial may be dispensed with\n    A court may, if the prosecutor and defendant agree, dispense with or terminate an investigation into the defendant's fitness to stand trial and –\n            (a) record a finding that the defendant is unfit to stand trial; or\n            (b) proceed under section 13 as if, after the investigation, the court had made a finding that the defendant is not unfit to stand trial.\n\n20. Same jury to determine all issues\n    Unless a judge otherwise orders, the same jury may be empanelled for the purposes of –\n            (a) an investigation under section 12 as to whether or not a defendant is fit to stand trial; and\n            (b) a special hearing under section 15 as to whether the defendant is not guilty of an offence with which he or she is charged; and\n            (c) the trial for the offence with which the defendant is charged.\n\nPART 3 - Defence of Insanity\n\n21. Procedure for dealing with persons found not guilty by reason of insanity\n        (1) On a verdict that a person is not guilty of an offence on the ground of insanity or on a finding being made to that effect, the court is to –\n                (a) make a restriction order; or\n                (b) release the defendant and make a supervision order; or\n                (c) make a treatment order; or\n                (d) . . . . . . . .\n                (e) release the defendant on such conditions as the court considers appropriate; or\n                (f) release the defendant unconditionally.\n        (2) Despite subsection (1) , only the Supreme Court may make a restriction order or supervision order under that subsection.\n        (3) A treatment order made under subsection (1)(c) , whether before or after the commencement of the Crimes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2016, is taken to have been made under Division 2 of Part 3 of Chapter 2 of the Mental Health Act 2013 .\n\nPART 3A - Breach of Conditions on Release\n\n21A.
