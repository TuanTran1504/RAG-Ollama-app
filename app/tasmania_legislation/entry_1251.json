Pre-Commissioning  Following the hydrostatic testing, the applicant is to forward to the Director –        (a) results of the testing and a report in accordance with AS 2885 signed by a testing engineer accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities Australia; and        (b) confirmation that cleaning of the pipeline has been completed.          The Director, if satisfied that –        (a) the hydrostatic testing has been satisfactorily completed for the pipeline; and        (b) construction and rehabilitation activities for the pipeline have been completed –        will issue a written consent to commence the commissioning of the pipeline      Following the route inspection, the applicant must also provide the Director with confirmation that –        (a) the pipeline easement has been rehabilitated in accordance with any applicable environmental management plan; and        (b) required pipeline markers and signs for the pipeline have been installed.        The applicant must also provide the Director with –        (a) confirmation of function tests of main line valves and communication links; and        (b) full particulars of the person or body conducting the commissioning, including operational, maintenance and emergency arrangement.        The applicant must also submit to the Director a written request to commission the pipeline and introduce gas at a specified pressure.    3.  Operation  The applicant must provide the Director with –        (a) independent certification in accordance with section 27 of the Act that the safety case conforms to standards and codes prescribed by these regulations; and        (b) certification by a commissioning engineer that all critical pipeline safety equipment has been satisfactorily tested; and        (c) written confirmation that all action required to be done by the pipeline risk assessments or by a commissioning process has been done.        The applicant must also submit to the Director a written request to operate the pipeline, with a description of the route of the pipeline and a map showing the exact route of the pipeline and any significant landmarks drawn to a scale of 1:25 000 or such other scale as the Director may approve.
