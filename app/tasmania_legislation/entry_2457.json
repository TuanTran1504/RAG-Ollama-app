Expiry of driver licence\n        (1) Unless renewed, cancelled or surrendered, a driver licence expires at midnight at the end of the day recorded in the driver licence register as the licence expiry date.\n        (2) Nothing in these regulations prevents the Registrar from amending the driver licence register, on the Registrar's own initiative, to extend the licence expiry date in respect of a driver licence.\n        (3) The last day of the term for which a driver licence is issued or renewed (the licence expiry date) is to be recorded in the driver licence register and on the driver licence.\n        (4) If the Registrar extends, on the Registrar's own initiative, the licence expiry date in respect of a driver licence under subregulation (2) , the Registrar is to notify the holder of that driver licence of the new licence expiry date for that driver licence.\n\n36. Notices of renewal\n        (1) The Registrar may send a notice of renewal to the holder of a driver licence.\n        (2) A notice of renewal is to –\n                (a) be addressed to the holder of the driver licence; and\n                (b) remind the holder of the licence expiry date; and\n                (c) warn the holder that, if the licence is not renewed on or before the licence expiry date, the licence will expire; and\n                (d) if the licence to be renewed is a learner licence, state that, before the licence is renewed, the holder must successfully complete a test, or assessment, to the Registrar's satisfaction, to show that the holder continues to be competent to learn to drive motor vehicles of the relevant class.\n        (3) The Registrar's failure to send the notice, or the non-receipt of the notice, does not postpone the expiry of the driver licence or affect the obligation of the holder of the licence to ensure that the licence is renewed if he or she wishes to continue as a licensed driver.\n        (4) For the purposes of this Part, the Registrar may send a notice of renewal to the holder of a learner licence.\n\n37.
