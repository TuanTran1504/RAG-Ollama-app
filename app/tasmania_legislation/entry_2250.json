Passing over person entitled to grant in other circumstances\n    Nothing in rule 25 affects the discretion of the Court, a judge or the Registrar, in any circumstances, to –\n            (a) refuse to order the issue of a grant to a person otherwise entitled to apply for a grant; and\n            (b) order the issue of a grant to –\n                    (i) without limiting subparagraph (ii) , if there is more than one person entitled to a grant – any or all of the other persons so entitled; or\n                    (ii) any other person whom the Court, a judge or the Registrar considers appropriate.\n\n27. Person convicted of offence relating to deceased's death may be refused grant\n    The Registrar may refuse to order the issue of a grant to a person solely on the basis that –\n            (a) the person is otherwise entitled to apply for a grant in relation to a deceased's will or estate but has been convicted of an offence relating to the deceased's death; and\n            (b) a beneficiary indicates that they are opposed to having a grant issued to the person.\n\nPART 4 - Requirements for Documents\n\n28.
