Making of complaints\n        (1) A conduct complaint is to be made to the Board in writing and lodged with the Board's executive officer.\n        (2) The executive officer is not to accept the lodgement of a conduct complaint unless it –\n                (a) includes the complainant's name and indicates how the complainant would like to be contacted should it be necessary for the Board to do so; and\n                (b) describes the alleged conduct that is the subject of the complaint; and\n                (c) sets out the name and address of the property agent against whom the complaint is being made or sufficient information to identify the property agent; and\n                (d) if the complainant has already complained to the property agent about the conduct of the agent, contains details of the action taken by the complainant and any action taken by the agent as a result of the complaint.\n        (3) On receipt of a complaint, the executive officer is to –\n                (a) record the date on which the complaint was lodged; and\n                (b) bring the conduct complaint to the Board's attention at the first practicable opportunity.\n        (4) The executive officer is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that a person who wishes to make a conduct complaint is given such assistance as is necessary to enable that person to lodge a conduct complaint with the Board.\n\n88. Time limits for complaints\n        (1) A complaint cannot be dealt with (otherwise than to dismiss it) if the complaint is made more than 2 years after the conduct complained about is alleged to have occurred, unless the Board determines that –\n                (a) it would not cause injustice to deal with the complaint; or\n                (b) it is in the public interest to deal with the complaint.\n        (2) Subject to subsection (1), the Board may deal with a conduct complaint although the conduct complained about is alleged to have occurred before the commencement of this section.\n\n89. Further information and verification\n    The Board may require a complainant to do either or both of the following:\n            (a) give further information about the complaint;\n            (b) verify the complaint, or any further information, by statutory declaration.\n\n90. Property agent to be notified of complaint\n        (1) Unless a conduct complaint is summarily dismissed under section 92 , the Board must, within 7 days of the acceptance of the lodgement of a conduct complaint in respect of a property agent, give the property agent written notice of the receipt of the complaint.\n        (2) Despite subsection (1), the Board may withhold for a reasonable time giving notice in accordance with that subsection if the Board is satisfied that giving the notice may prejudice the investigation of the complaint.\n        (3) A notice given under subsection (1) must –\n                (a) set out details of the conduct complained about; and\n                (b) inform the property agent that the Board seeks submissions from the property agent in respect of that conduct; and\n                (c) contain details of any action already taken by the Board in respect of the complaint.\n\n91. Submission by property agent\n        (1) A property agent who is the subject of a conduct complaint may, within a period specified by the Board, make submissions to the Board about the conduct complaint or its subject matter or both.\n        (2) The Board may at its discretion extend the period in which submissions may be made.\n        (3) The Board must consider the submissions made by the property agent before deciding what action is to be taken in relation to the complaint.\n\n92. Summary dismissal of complaints\n        (1) The Board may dismiss a complaint if –\n                (a) any information it requests the complainant to provide to the Board is not provided within a reasonable time; or\n                (b) any information it has requested be verified by a statutory declaration is not verified in that way within a reasonable time; or\n                (c) the Board is satisfied that the complaint is vexatious, misconceived, frivolous or lacking in substance.\n        (2) The Board is to dismiss a conduct complaint if it is satisfied that the conduct complained about has been the subject of a previous complaint either by the same or another person and that appropriate action was taken in respect of that previous complaint.\n\n93. Withdrawal of complaints\n        (1) A complainant may give written notice to the executive officer of the Board withdrawing the conduct complaint.\n        (2) The executive officer is to bring the notice to the attention of the Board at the first practicable opportunity.\n        (3) Despite receipt of the notice, the Board may continue investigating the complaint if it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.\n        (4) A conduct complaint cannot be withdrawn if at the time of the notice of withdrawal the Board has referred the conduct complaint to the Tribunal.\n        (5) If a conduct complaint is withdrawn, the Board is to notify the property agent who is the subject of the conduct complaint of the withdrawal.\n        (6) A withdrawal of a conduct complaint does not prevent a conduct complaint being made by any other person in respect of the same conduct by the property agent.\n        (7) If a conduct complaint in respect of a property agent has been withdrawn, the person who made the complaint has no right to make a further conduct complaint about the same conduct without the approval of the Board, and the Board is not to give such approval unless it is satisfied that there is sufficient justification for accepting the conduct complaint again.\n\nDivision 4 - Investigations of conduct complaints\n\n94. Complaints to be investigated\n        (1) The Board is to investigate each conduct complaint accepted by it as efficiently and expeditiously as possible.\n        (2) The fact that the Board is carrying out an investigation under this Part in respect of the conduct of the property agent does not prejudice any investigation into the affairs of the property agent being carried out under any other part of this Act or under any other Act.\n\n95. Investigation on Board's initiative\n        (1) The Board may on its own initiative investigate the conduct of a property agent.\n        (2) If the Board investigates the conduct of a property agent on its own initiative, the resolution of the Board to do so is to be taken as acceptance by the Board of a conduct complaint.\n        (3) In such a case, the complainant is taken to be the Board, but nothing in this Part is to be taken as requiring the Board to serve any notice upon itself, but the Board must give notice to the property agent in accordance with section 90 .\n\n96. Appointment of investigator\n        (1) The Board may, in writing, appoint a committee or a suitably qualified person to investigate a complaint on the Board's behalf and report back to the Board on the findings of that investigation.\n        (2) If the Board appoints a committee or another person to carry out an investigation, it must give the property agent concerned written notice of the action it has taken, and advise the property agent that the property agent may make submissions to the committee or other person.\n        (3) As soon as practicable after completing an investigation, the investigator must give a written report of the investigation to the Board.\n\n97. Powers of investigation\n        (1) In this section –\n            specified means specified in a notice under subsection (2) .\n        (2) For the purposes of an investigation, the Board may give a written notice to a property agent, whose conduct is the subject of a conduct complaint, that requires the property agent to take the following actions:\n                (a) provide the Board with written information of a specified type, on or before a specified date, that is verified by statutory declaration;\n                (b) produce, at a specified time and specified place, a specified document, or a copy of the document;\n                (c) to otherwise assist or cooperate with the Board in the investigation of the complaint in a specified manner.\n        (3) If a document is produced to the Board in accordance with this section, the Board may inspect it, make copies of it or any part of it and retain it for so long as may be necessary to investigate the complaint.\n        (4) A property agent has no right to refuse to comply with a notice mentioned in subsection (2) on the grounds that to comply with the notice –\n                (a) would affect a lien the agent has over a document; or\n                (b) would involve a breach of confidence.\n        (5) A property agent who, when required to take all or any action mentioned in subsection (2) , fails to take all or any of those actions or who provides written information or a document that is false or misleading in a material particular is guilty of professional misconduct.\n        (6) The Board may, during the course of an investigation, serve more than one notice on a property agent under subsection (2) .\n\n98. Board may obtain search warrant to enter and search premises\n        (1) The Board may apply to a magistrate for the issue of a search warrant to enter premises where it is suspected that there may be found evidence relevant to a conduct complaint made to the Board in respect of a property agent.\n        (2) A magistrate to whom an application is made under this section may, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so, issue a search warrant.\n        (3) A warrant issued under subsection (2) authorises the person named in it, and any person whom that person may reasonably need for assistance, to enter the premises specified in the warrant and exercise any or all of the powers specified in subsection (4) that are not expressly excluded by the magistrate who issued the warrant.\n        (4) A person who has entered premises pursuant to a warrant issued under subsection (2) may –\n                (a) search the premises for information, documents or other material relevant to a conduct complaint; and\n                (b) take possession of any material relevant to a conduct complaint and retain it for as long as may be necessary to examine it to determine its evidentiary value; and\n                (c) make copies of material relevant to a conduct complaint or any part of any such material; and\n                (d) seize and take away any material relevant to a conduct complaint or any part of any such material; and\n                (e) with respect to any computer or other equipment that the person suspects on reasonable grounds may contain material relevant to a conduct complaint –\n                        (i) inspect and gain access to the computer or equipment; and\n                        (ii) download or otherwise obtain any documents or information; and\n                        (iii) make copies of any documents or information held in it; and\n                        (iv) seize and take away the computer or equipment or any part of it, provided adequate arrangements are made to enable the business of the property agent to continue; and\n                (f) request any person who is on the premises to do any of the following:\n                        (i) state his or her full name, date of birth and address;\n                        (ii) produce material relevant to a conduct complaint;\n                        (iii) operate equipment or facilities on the premises for a purpose relevant to the investigation of a conduct complaint;\n                        (iv) provide access (free of charge) to photocopying equipment on the premises that the investigator reasonably requires to enable the copying of material relevant to a conduct complaint;\n                        (v) give other assistance that the investigator reasonably requires to carry out the investigation; and\n                (g) do anything else reasonably necessary to obtain information or evidence for the purposes of the investigation of a conduct complaint.\n        (5) A person requested to do anything under subsection (4)(f) must not, without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with the request.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 500 penalty units.\n\n99.

Procedure for minor misconduct\n        (1) If the Board decides the conduct complained about only amounts to minor misconduct that can adequately be dealt with by the Board, it may, by written notice sent to the property agent, require the agent to provide the Board with a written explanation of the conduct before a date specified in the notice, being a date at least 14 days after the notice is sent.\n        (2) If the conduct could possibly relate to the physical or mental capacity of the property agent, the Board may, by written notice sent to the property agent, require the agent to undergo a medical examination before a date specified in the notice, being a date at least 28 days after the notice is sent.\n        (3) A notice under subsection (1) or (2) is to –\n                (a) specify the conduct complained about; and\n                (b) inform the property agent that, instead of complying with the notice, the agent may request the Board to refer the complaint to the Tribunal for determination.\n        (4) If the property agent complies with the requirement of a notice mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) , the Board is to determine if the complaint has been substantiated.\n        (5) If the Board decides that there is insufficient evidence to substantiate the complaint, the Board must dismiss the complaint and advise the property agent and complainant of the decision.\n        (6) However, if the Board is satisfied that the evidence substantiates the complaint, it may do either or both of the following:\n                (a) caution or reprimand the property agent;\n                (b) accept an undertaking from the agent to take or refrain from taking action specified by the Board.\n        (7) The Board must refer a complaint to the Tribunal if –\n                (a) at any time the property agent requests that it be referred to the Tribunal; or\n                (b) the property agent fails to comply with a notice mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) ; or\n                (c) at any time the Board decides that the conduct amounts to more than minor misconduct that can be dealt with adequately by the Board.\n\n102.
