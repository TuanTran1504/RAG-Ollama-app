Matters to be considered in determining application\n        (1) The Secretary must not decide to expunge a charge under section 12(2)(a) unless satisfied on reasonable grounds that –\n                (a) the offence with which the eligible person was charged is a homosexual offence or a cross-dressing offence; and\n                (b) in the case of a charge for a homosexual offence –\n                        (i) the eligible person would not have been charged with the homosexual offence but for the fact that the eligible person was suspected of having engaged in the conduct constituting the offence for the purposes of, or in connection with, sexual activity of a homosexual nature; and\n                        (ii) the conduct constituting the homosexual offence, if engaged in by the eligible person at the time of the making of the application, would not constitute an offence under the law of this State.\n        (2) In considering whether the test set out in subsection (1)(b)(ii) is satisfied, the Secretary must have regard to –\n                (a) whether any person involved in the conduct constituting the homosexual offence, including the eligible person, consented to the conduct; and\n                (b) the ages, or respective ages, of any such persons at the time of that conduct.\n        (3) If the consent of a person to the conduct is an issue in the decision to expunge a charge for a homosexual offence, the Secretary may only be satisfied by written evidence on that issue –\n                (a) from the official criminal records, if available; or\n                (b) from a person, other than the eligible person, who was involved in the conduct constituting the homosexual offence; or\n                (c) if no person referred to in paragraph (b) can be found after reasonable enquiries are made by the applicant, from a person (other than the applicant) with knowledge of the circumstances in which that conduct occurred.\n        (4) In considering an application, the Secretary may have regard to any matter he or she reasonably considers relevant in the circumstances.\n\n11. Withdrawal of application\n        (1) An applicant may withdraw an application before the Secretary determines it.\n        (2) Despite an application being withdrawn under this section, the Secretary may reinstate the application if satisfied that the applicant wishes to proceed with it and has provided any information required under section 7(1) or further information or documents required under section 8(3) .\n        (3) For the avoidance of doubt, the withdrawal under this section of an application in relation to a charge does not, in itself, prevent any further applications being made in relation to that charge.\n\n12. Determination of application\n        (1) The Secretary must determine an application as soon as practicable after it is received.\n        (2) In determining an application, the Secretary is to, in respect of each charge to which the application relates, decide to –\n                (a) expunge the charge for that offence; or\n                (b) refuse to expunge the charge for that offence.\n        (3) If the Secretary intends to make a decision to refuse to expunge a charge, the Secretary must –\n                (a) by notice in writing, inform the applicant of that intention and the reasons for the intended decision; and\n                (b) provide the applicant with a copy of any relevant records, relating to the application, in the possession of the Secretary; and\n                (c) give the applicant 28 days from the date of that notice to submit further information to the Secretary regarding the charge.\n        (4) The Secretary must, within 28 days after a decision under this section is made, give –\n                (a) the applicant written notice of the decision and, if the decision is to refuse to expunge a charge, inform the applicant of –\n                        (i) the reasons for the decision; and\n                        (ii) the applicant's right to have the decision reviewed under section 21 ; and\n                (b) any person who has made a submission pursuant to section 8(6) written notice of the decision and, if the decision is to expunge a charge, inform the person of –\n                        (i) the reasons for the decision; and\n                        (ii) the person's right to have the decision reviewed under section 21 .\n        (5) On making a decision to expunge a charge, the Secretary must, within 28 days, notify any relevant data controller of –\n                (a) that decision and the reasons for the decision; and\n                (b) the data controller's right to have the decision reviewed under section 21 .\n        (6) If the Secretary makes a decision to expunge a charge, the charge, and any conviction in respect of that charge, is expunged at the expiration of 90 days after the day on which the Secretary makes the decision.\n        (7) Despite subsection (6) , if within those 90 days an interested person has applied for a review under section 21 in relation to the decision, the decision to expunge a charge –\n                (a) does not take effect until all reviews in respect of the decision have been determined; and\n                (b) only takes effect if, in respect of each review –\n                        (i) the decision of the Secretary is upheld; or\n                        (ii) the review is abandoned or withdrawn by the person applying for that review.\n\n13. Confidentiality\n        (1) A person must not, directly or indirectly, make a record of, or disclose or communicate to another person, any information, relating to an application, acquired by the person for the purposes of this Act.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 50 penalty units.\n        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if –\n                (a) it is necessary to make the record, or disclose or communicate the information, for the purposes of this Act; or\n                (b) the person to whom the information relates gives written consent to the making of the record or to the disclosure or communication.\n        (3) Subsection (1) also does not apply to the disclosure or communication of information –\n                (a) to a court or tribunal in the course of a legal proceeding; or\n                (b) under an order of a court or tribunal; or\n                (c) to a legal practitioner for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or representation; or\n                (d) as required or authorised by or under this Act or any other Act.\n\nPART 3 - Consequences of Expungement\n\n14.
