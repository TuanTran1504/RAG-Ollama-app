  "text": "Commercial Arbitration Act 2011\n\nAn Act relating to the conduct of commercial arbitrations, to repeal the Commercial Arbitration Act 1986 and for other purposes\n[Royal Assent 16 June 2011]\n\nBe it enacted by His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and House of Assembly, in Parliament assembled, as follows:\n\nPART 1A - Preliminary\n\n        Note\n    Sections of this Act that contain a reference to the \"Model Law\" in the heading are substantially the same as the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (as adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 21 June 1985 with amendments as adopted by that Commission in 2006) so as to be as uniform as possible with the UNCITRAL Model Law. Some changes have been made to those provisions of the Act based on the UNCITRAL Model Law to amend or supplement the provisions in their application to domestic arbitrations in Tasmania or to accommodate modern drafting styles and conventions (for example, provisions are drafted in gender neutral terms and archaisms are replaced with modern alternatives). Notes draw attention to substantive changes. The original numbering of the \"articles\" of the UNCITRAL Model Law has been retained but converted to references to \"sections\" and articles containing more than one sentence have been reformatted into subsections. There are a number of additional provisions to those based on the UNCITRAL Model Law.\n\n1A. Short title\n    This Act may be cited as the Commercial Arbitration Act 2011 .\n\n1B. Commencement\n    The provisions of this Act commence on a day or days to be proclaimed.\n\n1C. Paramount object of Act\n        (1) The paramount object of this Act is to facilitate the fair and final resolution of commercial disputes by impartial arbitral tribunals without unnecessary delay or expense.\n        (2) This Act aims to achieve its paramount object by –\n                (a) enabling parties to agree about how their commercial disputes are to be resolved (subject to subsection (3) and such safeguards as are necessary in the public interest); and\n                (b) providing arbitration procedures that enable commercial disputes to be resolved in a cost-effective manner, informally and quickly.\n        (3) This Act must be interpreted, and the functions of an arbitral tribunal must be exercised, so that (as far as practicable) the paramount object of this Act is achieved.\n        (4) Subsection (3) does not affect the operation of section 8A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 .\n\n1D. Act binds Crown\n    This Act binds the Crown in right of Tasmania and, so far as the legislative power of Parliament permits, in all its other capacities.\n\nPART 1 - General Provisions\n\n1. Scope of application (cf Model Law Art 1)\n        (1) This Act applies to domestic commercial arbitrations.\n        Note. The International Arbitration Act 1974 of the Commonwealth covers international commercial arbitrations and the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.\n                                                                                                                                                                     \n        \n            (2) The provisions of this Act, except sections 8 , 9 , 17H , 17I , 17J , 35 and 36 , apply only if the place of arbitration is in Tasmania.\n            (3) An arbitration is \"domestic\" if –\n                    (a) the parties to an arbitration agreement have, at the time of the conclusion of that agreement, their places of business in Australia; and\n                    (b) the parties have (whether in the arbitration agreement or in any other document in writing) agreed that any dispute that has arisen or may arise between them is to be settled by arbitration; and\n                    (c) it is not an arbitration to which the Model Law (as given effect by the International Arbitration Act 1974 of the Commonwealth) applies.\n            (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) –\n                    (a) if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the arbitration agreement; and\n                    (b) if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to the party's habitual residence.\n            (5) This Act does not affect any other Act by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration or may be submitted to arbitration only according to provisions other than those of this Act.\n            (6) Subject to subsection (5) , this Act applies to arbitrations provided for in any other Act as if –\n                    (a) the other Act were an arbitration agreement; and\n                    (b) the arbitration were pursuant to an arbitration agreement; and\n                    (c) the parties to the dispute which, by virtue of the other Act, is referred to arbitration were the parties to the arbitration agreement –\n            except in so far as the other Act otherwise indicates or requires.\n            Model Law note. The term \"commercial\" should be given a wide interpretation so as to cover matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature, whether contractual or not. Relationships of a commercial nature include, but are not limited to, the following transactions: any trade transaction for the supply or exchange of goods or services; distribution agreement; commercial representation or agency; factoring; leasing; construction of works; consulting; engineering; licensing; investment; financing; banking; insurance; exploitation agreement or concession; joint venture and other forms of industrial or business cooperation; carriage of goods or passengers by air, sea, rail or road.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n            \n            Note. This section differs from the Model Law to the extent necessary to apply Art 1 as incorporated in this Act to domestic commercial arbitrations. Section 40 contains provisions that also relate to the application of this Act.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n            \n\n            2.

International origin and general principles (cf Model Law Art 2A)\n                            (1) Subject to section 1C , in the interpretation of this Act, regard is to be had to the need to promote so far as practicable uniformity between the application of this Act to domestic commercial arbitrations and the application of the provisions of the Model Law (as given effect by the International Arbitration Act 1974 of the Commonwealth) to international commercial arbitrations and the observance of good faith.\n                            (2) .\n                            (3) Without limiting subsection (1) , in interpreting this Act, reference may be made to the documents relating to the Model Law of –\n                                    (a) the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law; and\n                                    (b) its working groups for the preparation of the Model Law.\n                            (4) Subsection (3) does not affect the application of section 8B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 for the purposes of interpreting this Act.\n                            Note. This section differs from the Model Law. Art 2A(1) has been changed as a consequence of the application of the Act to domestic (instead of international) commercial arbitrations. Art 2A(2) is omitted because it is covered by the provision referred to in section 1C(4) . Subsections (3) and (4) reflect section 17 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 of the Commonwealth.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n                            \n\n                        3. Receipt of written communications (cf Model Law Art 3)\n                                (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties –\n                                        (a) any written communication is taken to be received if –\n                                                (i) it is delivered to the addressee personally; or\n                                                (ii) it is delivered at the addressee's place of business, habitual residence or mailing address; or\n                                                (iii) if none of these can be found after making a reasonable inquiry, it is delivered to the addressee's last-known place of business, habitual residence or mailing address by registered letter or any other means which provides a record of the attempt to deliver it; and\n                                        (b) the communication is taken to have been received on the day it is so delivered.\n                                (2) The provisions of this section do not apply to communications in court proceedings.\n\n                        4. Waiver of right to object (cf Model Law Art 4)\n                            A party who knows that any provision of this Act from which the parties may derogate or any requirement under the arbitration agreement has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating the party's objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time-limit is provided for stating the party's objection, within such period of time, is taken to have waived the party's right to object.\n\n                        5. Extent of court intervention (cf Model Law Art 5)\n                            In matters governed by this Act, no court must intervene except where so provided by this Act.\n\n                        6. Court for certain functions of arbitration assistance and supervision (cf Model Law Art 6)\n                                (1) The functions referred to in section 11(3) and (4) , 13(4) , 14(2) , 16(9) , 17H , 17I , 17J , 19(6) , 27 , 27A , 27B , 27H , 27I , 27J , 33D , 34 and 34A are, subject to subsection (2) , to be performed by the Supreme Court.\n                                (2) If –\n                                        (a) an arbitration agreement provides that the Magistrates Court (Civil Division) is to have jurisdiction under this Act; or\n                                        (b) the parties to an arbitration agreement have agreed in writing that the Magistrates Court (Civil Division) is to have jurisdiction under this Act and that agreement is in force –\n                                the functions are to be performed, in relation to that agreement, by the Magistrates Court (Civil Division).\n                                Note. This section differs from the Model Law to the extent that it relates to functions conferred on the Court with respect to domestic commercial arbitrations that are not referred to in the Model Law.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                \n\n                            PART 2 - Arbitration Agreement\n\n                            7. Definition and form of arbitration agreement (cf Model Law Art 7)\n                                    (1) An \"arbitration agreement\" is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not.\n                                    (2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.\n                                    (3) The arbitration agreement must be in writing.\n                                    (4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if its content is recorded in any form whether or not the arbitration agreement or contract has been concluded orally, by conduct, or by other means.\n                                    (5) The requirement that an arbitration agreement be in writing is met by an electronic communication if the information contained in it is accessible so as to be useable for subsequent reference.\n                                    (6) In this section –\n                                        data message means information generated, sent, received or stored by electronic, magnetic, optical or similar means, including, but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy;\n                                        electronic communication means any communication that the parties make by means of data messages.\n                                    (7) Furthermore, an arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other.\n                                    (8) The reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement in writing, provided that the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.\n                                    Note. This section is substantially the same as Option 1 set out in Art 7 of the Model Law.\n                                                                                                                               \n                                    \n\n                                8. Arbitration agreement and substantive claim before court (cf Model Law Art 8)\n                                        (1) A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement must, if a party so requests not later than when submitting the party's first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n                                        (2) Where an action referred to in subsection (1) has been brought, arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commenced or continued, and an award may be made, while the issue is pending before the court.\n\n                                9. Arbitration agreement and interim measures by court (cf Model Law Art 9)\n                                    It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an interim measure of protection and for a court to grant the measure.\n\n                                PART 3 - Composition of Arbitral Tribunal\n\n                                10. Number of arbitrators (cf Model Law Art 10)\n                                        (1) The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.\n                                        (2) Failing such determination, the number of arbitrators is to be one.\n                                        Note. Subsection (2) differs from Art 10(2) of the Model Law, which provides for 3 arbitrators if the parties do not determine the number of arbitrators.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n                                        \n\n                                    11. Appointment of arbitrators (cf Model Law Art 11)\n                                            (1) .\n                                            Note. Art 11 (1) of the Model Law (which provides that no person is precluded by nationality from acting as an arbitrator unless otherwise agreed by the parties) has been omitted.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n                                            \n                                                (2) The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, subject to the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) .\n                                                (3) Failing such agreement –\n                                                        (a) in an arbitration with 3 arbitrators and 2 parties, each party is to appoint one arbitrator, and the 2 arbitrators so appointed are to appoint the third arbitrator; if a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within 30 days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party, or if the 2 arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointment, the appointment is to be made, on the request of a party, by the Court; and\n                                                        (b) in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, an arbitrator is to be appointed, on the request of a party, by the Court; and\n                                                        (c) in an arbitration with 2, 4 or more arbitrators or with 3 arbitrators and more than 2 parties, the appointment is to be made, at the request of a party, by the Court.\n                                                (4) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed on by the parties –\n                                                        (a) a party fails to act as required under the procedure; or\n                                                        (b) the parties, or 2 or more arbitrators, are unable to reach an agreement expected of them under the procedure; or\n                                                        (c) a third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it under the procedure –\n                                                any party may request the Court to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.\n                                                (5) A decision within the limits of the Court's authority on a matter entrusted by subsection (3) or (4) to the Court is final.\n                                                (6) The Court, in appointing an arbitrator, is to have due regard to any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator.\n                                                Note. This section (other than subsections (3)(c) , (5) and (6) ) is substantially the same as Art 11 of the Model Law. Subsection (3)(c) is added to cover the contingency of the parties failing to agree on the procedure to appoint arbitrators in certain circumstances not covered by the Model Law as incorporated in this Act. It is based on clause 11(6) of Schedule 1 to the Arbitration Act 1996 (NZ). Subsection (5) makes it clear that, although a decision of the Court is generally final, review of a decision of the Court that is not made within the limits of its powers and functions is not precluded. Subsection (6) does not include the requirement in Art 11(5) of the Model Law that the Court take into account the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than those of the parties in appointing a sole or third arbitrator as this is not relevant in the context of domestic commercial arbitrations.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                \n\n                                            12. Grounds for challenge (cf Model Law Art 12)\n                                                    (1) When a person is approached in connection with the person's possible appointment as an arbitrator, the person must disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to the person's impartiality or independence.\n                                                    (2) An arbitrator, from the time of the arbitrator's appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, must without delay disclose any circumstances of the kind referred to in subsection (1) to the parties unless they have already been informed of them by the arbitrator.\n                                                    (3) An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence, or if the arbitrator does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties.\n                                                    (4) A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by the party, or in whose appointment the party has participated, only for reasons of which the party becomes aware after the appointment has been made.\n                                                    (5) For the purposes of subsection (1) , there are justifiable doubts as to the impartiality or independence of a person approached in connection with a possible appointment as arbitrator only if there is a real danger of bias on the part of the person in conducting the arbitration.\n                                                    (6) For the purposes of subsection (3) , there are justifiable doubts as to the impartiality or independence of an arbitrator only if there is a real danger of bias on the part of the arbitrator in conducting the arbitration.\n                                                    Note. This section (other than subsections (5) and (6) ) is substantially the same as Art 12 of the Model Law. Subsections (5) and (6) provide that the test for whether there are justifiable doubts as to the impartiality or independence of a person or arbitrator is whether there is a real danger of bias.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n                                                    \n\n                                                13.

Section 13 (other than subsection (5) ) is substantially the same as Art 13 of the Model Law. Subsection (5) makes it clear that, although a decision of the Court is generally final, review of a decision of the Court that is not made within the limits of its powers and functions is not precluded.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                        \n\n                                                    14.

Section 14 (other than subsection (3) ) is substantially the same as Art 14 of the Model Law. Subsection (3) makes it clear that, although a decision of the Court is generally final, review of a decision of the Court that is not made within the limits of its powers and functions is not precluded.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                            \n\n                                                        15.

Section 16 (other than subsection (10) ) is substantially the same as Art 16 of the Model Law.

This section (other than subsections (1) and (4) ) is substantially the same as Art 23 of the Model Law.
