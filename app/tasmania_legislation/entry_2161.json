Legal effect of invalid administrative actions\n    Every invalid administrative action has, and is deemed always to have had, the same force and effect for all purposes as it would have had if –\n            (a) it had been taken, or purportedly taken, by a State authority or officer of the State; and\n            (b) the relevant function or power had been duly conferred on that authority or officer.\n\n6. Rights and liabilities declared in certain cases\n        (1) Without affecting the generality of section 5 , the rights and liabilities of all persons are, by force of this Act, declared to be, and always to have been, for all purposes the same as if –\n                (a) every invalid administrative action had been taken, or purportedly taken, by a State authority or officer of the State; and\n                (b) the relevant function or power had been duly conferred on that authority or officer.\n        (2) A right or liability conferred or affected by subsection (1) –\n                (a) is exercisable or enforceable; and\n                (b) is to be regarded as always having been exercisable or enforceable –\n        as if it were a right or liability conferred or affected by (or arising from) an administrative action of a State authority or officer of the State on which or whom the relevant function or power had been duly conferred.\n        (3) Any act or thing done or omitted to be done at or before the commencement time under or in relation to a right or liability conferred or affected by subsection (1) –\n                (a) has the same effect, and gives rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law; and\n                (b) is to be regarded as always having had the same effect, and given rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law –\n        as if it were done, or omitted to be done, to give effect to, or under the authority of, or in reliance on, an administrative action of a State authority or officer of the State on which or whom the relevant function or power had been duly conferred.\n\n7. Registration or incorporation of companies\n    Without affecting the generality of sections 5 and 6 , it is declared that those sections extend to the registration or incorporation, or purported registration or incorporation, of companies by, or consequent on administrative action taken or purportedly taken by, Commonwealth authorities or officers of the Commonwealth at or before the commencement time.\n\n8. This Act to apply to administrative actions as purportedly in force from time to time\n        (1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that this Act operates to give to an invalid administrative action that has subsequently been affected by another action or process no greater effect than it would have had if the administrative action, or any other relevant administrative action, had not been invalid on constitutional grounds (arising from the circumstances referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of invalid administrative action in section 3 ).\n        (2) If administrative action taken by a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth was affected (whether by way of revocation, modification or otherwise) at or before the commencement time by any later administrative action or by any judicial process or by any administrative review process, this Act applies to the administrative action as so affected from time to time.\n        (3) In this section, a reference to administrative action taken includes a reference to administrative action purportedly taken, and a reference to administrative action affected in any way includes a reference to administrative action purportedly affected in that way.\n\n9. Corresponding authorities or officers\n    It is immaterial, for the purposes of this Act, that a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth does not have a counterpart in the State, or that the powers and functions of a counterpart State authority or a counterpart officer of the State do not correspond exactly or substantially with those of the Commonwealth authority or the officer of the Commonwealth.\n\n10. Act not to give rise to liability against the State\n        (1) The State is not liable to any action, liability, claim or demand arising from the enactment, commencement or operation of this Act.\n        (2) Without limiting subsection (1) , no proceedings lie against the State in respect of an administrative action affected by this Act, except to the extent that the proceedings would lie had this Act not been enacted.\n        (3) In this section –\n            proceedings includes proceedings for an order in the nature of prohibition, certiorari or mandamus or for a declaration or injunction or for any other relief;\n            the State includes any State authority or officer of the State, and also includes –\n                    (a) the Crown in right of the State; and\n                    (b) the Government of the State; and\n                    (c) a Minister of the Crown in right of the State; and\n                    (d) a statutory corporation, or other body, representing the Crown in right of the State.\n\n11.
