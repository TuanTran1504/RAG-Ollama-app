or\n                        (ii) a payment under the Long Service Leave Act 1976 in lieu of long service leave; and\n                (b) on the employee transfer date for the employee, the transferred employee –\n                        (i) has not retained an entitlement to a period of long service leave, in accordance with subsection (3)(b) , in respect of those years of continuous employment;

and\n                        (ii) any relevant award, agreement or other Act; and\n                (b) is not entitled to compensation, or another form of consideration or payment, solely due to the transfer of the employee under this Act; and\n                (c) is not entitled to seek compensation, or another form of consideration or payment, from the Department or State, in respect of an action taken by the former employer before the employee transfer date for the employee; and\n                (d) is not entitled to commence legal proceedings, against the Department or State, if the proceedings –\n                        (i) relate to a right or liability that had accrued, and was in existence, immediately before the employee transfer date for the employee; and\n                        (ii) do not relate to a decision of, or action by, the Department or State; and\n                        (iii) if this Act had not commenced, could have been instituted by the transferred employee against the former employer.\n        (6) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in subsection (5) prevents a transferred employee from seeking compensation, consideration or payment from, or commencing legal proceedings against, the former employer in respect of actions taken by, or not taken by, the former employer before the employee transfer date for the employee.\n\n11.
