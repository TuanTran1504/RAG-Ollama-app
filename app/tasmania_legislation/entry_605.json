Effect of interstate travel permit issued to local offender\n        (1) This section applies in respect of any period during which –\n                (a) an interstate travel permit is in force in respect of a local offender; and\n                (b) the local offender is present in an interstate jurisdiction to which the permit authorises travel.\n        (2) For the purposes of the law of this jurisdiction with respect to local sentences –\n                (a) the conditions of the interstate travel permit are taken to be substituted for the conditions of the relevant local sentence; and\n                (b) any compliance or non-compliance by the offender with the conditions of the interstate travel permit are taken to be compliance or non-compliance, as the case may be, with the conditions of the relevant local sentence.\n\n13D. Powers exercisable in relation to interstate offenders\n        (1) This section applies to an interstate offender –\n                (a) who holds an interstate travel permit that authorises the offender to travel to this jurisdiction; and\n                (b) who is present in this jurisdiction.\n        (2) The local authority may issue a warrant for the offender's arrest –\n                (a) if advised by the relevant interstate authority that the interstate travel permit is no longer in force in this jurisdiction; or\n                (b) if of the opinion that the offender has failed to comply with the conditions of the interstate travel permit.\n        (3) A warrant under subsection (2) is sufficient authority for a local law enforcement officer –\n                (a) to arrest the offender; and\n                (b) to convey the offender to a place specified in the warrant (whether in this jurisdiction or an interstate jurisdiction); and\n                (c) to deliver the offender into the custody of an interstate law enforcement officer of the jurisdiction in which the interstate travel permit was issued.\n        (4) For the avoidance of doubt, a warrant issued under subsection (2) authorises a local law enforcement officer to convey the offender within or across any interstate jurisdiction for the purpose of taking the offender to a place specified in the warrant.\n\n13E. Powers of interstate law enforcement officers\n    A warrant issued under the corresponding law of an interstate jurisdiction that authorises an interstate law enforcement officer of that jurisdiction to convey an interstate offender or local offender within or across this jurisdiction for the purpose of taking the offender to a place specified in the warrant has effect, in this jurisdiction, according to its tenor.\n\n13F.
