Effect of ademptions of testamentary gifts by attorney under enduring power of attorney\n        (1) In this section, a reference to a dealing with property includes a sale, mortgage, charge or disposition of property and any other dealing with property.\n        (2) A person who is a beneficiary (a relevant beneficiary) under the will of a deceased donor of an enduring power of attorney has the same interest in any surplus money or other property arising from a dealing with property by the attorney under the enduring power of attorney as the relevant beneficiary would have had, in the property that is the subject of the dealing, if the dealing had not been made.\n        (3) The surplus money or other property arising from the dealing with property as referred to in subsection (1) is taken to be of the same nature as the property dealt with.\n        (4) The Supreme Court, on the application of a relevant beneficiary, under the will of a deceased donor of an enduring power of attorney, to whom subsection (2) relates or another person who the Supreme Court considers has a proper interest in the matter, may –\n                (a) make the orders, and direct the conveyances, deeds and things to be executed and done as it thinks fit in order to give effect to subsections (2) and (3) ; or\n                (b) if it considers that the operation of subsections (2) and (3) would result in one or more relevant beneficiaries –\n                        (i) gaining an unjust and disproportionate advantage; or\n                        (ii) suffering an unjust and disproportionate disadvantage –\n                of a kind not contemplated by the will, make such other orders as the Supreme Court thinks fit to ensure that no relevant beneficiary gains such an advantage or suffers such a disadvantage.\n        (4A) An application under subsection (4) is to be made not later than 3 months after the date of the grant of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, of the deceased person.\n        (4B) The Supreme Court may extend the period referred to in subsection (4A) if it considers it necessary.\n        (5) An order made by the Supreme Court under subsection (4)(b) –\n                (a) may provide that it has effect as if it had been made by a codicil to the will of the donor of the enduring power of attorney executed immediately before the donor's death; and\n                (b) has effect despite anything to the contrary in subsection (1) or (2) .\n\n32A. Substitution of The Public Trustee as attorney\n        (1) If –\n                (a) an enduring power of attorney appoints only one attorney, that attorney may appoint The Public Trustee to act as attorney in his or her place; or\n                (b) an enduring power of attorney appoints more than one attorney, those attorneys jointly may appoint The Public Trustee to act as sole attorney in their places.\n        (2) An appointment under subsection (1) is to be –\n                (a) in accordance with form 6 ; and\n                (b) signed by the attorney or all attorneys; and\n                (c) accepted by The Public Trustee in accordance with that form.\n        (3) An appointment is of no effect until registered by the Recorder.\n        (4) If The Public Trustee is appointed to act as attorney under this section, a reference in this Act to an attorney is taken to be a reference to The Public Trustee.\n\n33. Power of Tribunal to make orders in respect of enduring power of attorney\n        (1AA) In this section, a reference to an enduring power of attorney includes a reference to a purported enduring power of attorney.\n        (1) The Tribunal may –\n                (a) of its own motion; or\n                (b) on application by an attorney; or\n                (c) on application by or on behalf of a donor; or\n                (d) on application by any other person who the Tribunal believes has a proper interest in the matter –\n        hold a hearing in accordance with the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020 to review an enduring power of attorney.\n        (1A) The Tribunal may dismiss an application for review if it is of the opinion that the application is frivolous, vexatious or lacking in substance.\n        (1B) Without limiting the matters to which the Tribunal may have regard in relation to a review in respect of a donor, the Tribunal may open and read any paper or writing which purports to be, or is alleged to be, the will of the donor.\n        (2) On the review, the Tribunal may, by order –\n                (a) vary a term of, or a power conferred by, the enduring power of attorney; or\n                (b) appoint a substitute attorney; or\n                (c) appoint an administrator of the estate of the donor if he or she is over the age of 18 years; or\n                (d) declare that the donor did or did not have mental capacity to make a valid enduring power of attorney or to revoke an enduring power of attorney; or\n                (e) declare that the enduring power of attorney or the revocation of it by the donor is invalid if the Tribunal is satisfied that –\n                        (i) the donor did not have the mental capacity to make the power or the revocation, respectively; or\n                        (ii) the power or the revocation, respectively, does not comply with the other requirements of this Act; or\n                        (iii) the power or the revocation, respectively, is invalid because the donor was induced to make it by dishonesty or undue influence or invalid for any other reason; or\n                (f) revoke the enduring power of attorney and, if the donor is over the age of 18 years and the Tribunal thinks fit, appoint an administrator of his or her estate; or\n                (g) make such other order as to the exercise of the power, or the construction of its terms, as the Tribunal thinks fit.\n        (3) An appointment of a person as administrator under subsection (2)(f) has the same effect as if it had been made under Part 7 of the Guardianship and Administration Act 1995 .\n        (4) When the Tribunal considers it proper to do so by reason of urgency, the Tribunal may suspend the attorney under an enduring power of attorney and, on doing so, the attorney ceases, for the period of the suspension, to be authorised to take any action under the power of attorney and the Tribunal may –\n                (a) appoint the Public Trustee or any other person as a substitute attorney to act in the place of the suspended attorney for the period for which the suspension remains in force; and\n                (b) make such other orders, and give such other directions, as to the exercise of the power as it thinks fit.\n        (4A) The Tribunal may –\n                (a) suspend, for the period specified in the order, the attorney under an enduring power of attorney if the attorney (in this section referred to as the suspended attorney) fails to comply, with a direction of the Tribunal, within a reasonable period after the direction is given; and\n                (b) appoint the Public Trustee or any other person to act as the attorney, in the place of the suspended attorney, for the period for which the suspension remains in force; and\n                (c) if an attorney in relation to an enduring power of attorney is suspended under paragraph (a) , make such other orders, and give such other directions, as to the exercise of the power as it thinks fit; and\n                (d) if an attorney is suspended under paragraph (a) , revoke the suspension, if the Tribunal is satisfied that the suspended attorney has complied with the direction to which the suspension relates; and\n                (e) if, after conducting a hearing in relation to the matter, in accordance with the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020 , to review an enduring power of attorney, it is satisfied that a suspended attorney in relation to a power of attorney has, after the expiration of a reasonable period after the suspension of the attorney under paragraph (a) , continued to fail to comply with the direction to which the suspension related, revoke the power of attorney.\n        (4B) If an attorney is suspended under subsection (4A) –\n                (a) the suspension does not prevent the suspended attorney taking the actions necessary to comply with the direction to which the suspension relates, but the suspended attorney may not otherwise exercise during the suspension the power of attorney; and\n                (b) a person appointed under subsection (4A)(b) may, during the period of the suspension, act as the attorney, in the place of the suspended attorney, for the purposes of a power of attorney.\n        (5) In the exercise of its powers under subsection (4) or subsection (4A) –\n                (a) the Tribunal is not required to give notice to any person or, subject to subsection (4A)(e) , to hold a hearing before making an order but the Tribunal must make such inquiries or investigations as may be appropriate; and\n                (b) the Tribunal may act on a request made, or information received, by telephone or any other means that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n        (6) An order under subsection (4) –\n                (a) remains in effect for such period as the Tribunal determines but not exceeding 28 days; and\n                (b) may be renewed but only once for a further period not exceeding 28 days.\n        (6A) If the Tribunal adjourns a hearing held under this section, the Tribunal may make any interim order or give any directions it considers appropriate, including making an order appointing The Public Trustee as administrator of the estate of the donor.\n        (6B) Subsection (6A) does not authorise the Tribunal to suspend an attorney under an enduring power of attorney, or extend such a suspension, which may only be done by the Tribunal under subsection (4) or (4A) or subsection (6)(b) .\n        (6C) An interim order has effect for the period of the adjournment and any subsequent adjournment or as specified in the interim order.\n        (6D) The Tribunal may vary or revoke an interim order or make a further or subsequent interim order.\n        (7) An order under this section may be made subject to such terms and conditions as the Tribunal thinks fit.\n        (8) On making an order under this section, the Tribunal must forward a copy of the order to the Recorder who must register it.\n\n34.
