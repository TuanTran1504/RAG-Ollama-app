Interpretation of Part 2A\n    In this Part –\n        party in the chain of responsibility, for an on-demand passenger transport service, means each of the following persons:\n                (a) an accredited operator of the service;\n                (b) a relevant responsible person for an accredited operator of the service;\n                (c) an affiliated operator in relation to a booking service provider who is an accredited operator in relation to the service;\n                (d) a driver of a vehicle used for the provision of the service;\n                (e) a registered operator of a vehicle used in the provision of the service;\n        safety duty means a duty specified in section 33G , section 33H , section 33I or section 33J .\n\n33D. Reasonably practicable\n    In this Part, reasonably practicable, in relation to a safety duty of a person, is a reference to what is, or what was at a particular time, reasonably able to be done by the person in relation to ensuring safety, taking into account and weighing up all relevant matters including –\n            (a) the likelihood of the hazard or the risk concerned occurring; and\n            (b) the degree of harm that might result from the hazard or risk; and\n            (c) what the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, about –\n                    (i) the hazard or risk; and\n                    (ii) ways of eliminating or minimising the hazard or risk; and\n            (d) the availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise the risk; and\n            (e) after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk – the cost associated with the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, including whether the cost is grossly disproportionate to the risk.\n\n33E. Principles of shared responsibility\n        (1) The safety of the operations of an on-demand transport service is the shared responsibility of each person who is a party in the chain of responsibility in relation to the on-demand transport service.\n        (2) The level and nature of a persons responsibility for an activity depends on –\n                (a) the functions that the person performs or is required to perform, whether exclusively or occasionally; and\n                (b) the nature of the safety risks created by the carrying out of the activity; and\n                (c) the persons capacity to control, eliminate or minimise the risks.\n\n33F. Principles applying to safety duties\n        (1) A safety duty of a person may not be transferred to another person.\n        (2) A person may have more than one safety duty by virtue of being a person to whom more than one provision of this Part applies.\n        (3) More than one person may concurrently have the same safety duty and each person must comply with the safety duty even if another person has the same safety duty.\n        (4) If more than one person has a safety duty for the same matter, each person –\n                (a) retains responsibility for the persons safety duty in relation to the matter; and\n                (b) must discharge the persons safety duty to the extent to which the person –\n                        (i) has the capacity to influence and control the matter; or\n                        (ii) would have had that capacity but for an agreement or arrangement purporting to limit or remove that capacity.\n\n33G.

Refusal of application for authorisation\n        (1) This section applies if the Commission refuses to approve an application for the authorisation of a regular passenger service.\n        (2) The Commission is to notify the applicant of –\n                (a) the refusal; and\n                (b) the reasons for the refusal; and\n                (c) the applicant's rights of review.\n        (3) Subsection (2) also applies if, pursuant to section 37(4) , the Commission did not consider the application.\n\n39. Approval of application for authorisation\n        (1) This section applies if the Commission approves an application for the authorisation of a regular passenger service.\n        (2) The Commission may place such conditions on the authorisation as it considers necessary or expedient having regard to the nature of the service.\n        (3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (2) , the Commission may place on the authorisation conditions about any or all of the following:\n                (a) the kinds of passenger vehicles that may be used;\n                (b) the route to be followed;\n                (c) the timetable, including the frequency of service;\n                (d) passenger stops;\n                (e) fares and fare waivers, rebates and discounts;\n                (f) a minimum period of operation.\n        (4) In a case to which this section applies, the Commission is to notify the applicant of –\n                (a) the approval; and\n                (b) if applicable, the conditions placed on the authorisation and the applicant's rights of review in respect of those conditions.\n\n40.
