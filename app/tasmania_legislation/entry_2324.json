Commencement of representative proceedings\n        (1) Subject to this Part, if –\n                (a) 7 or more persons have claims against the same person; and\n                (b) the claims of all those persons are in respect of, or arise out of, the same, similar or related circumstances; and\n                (c) the claims of all those persons give rise to a substantial common question of law or fact –\n        proceedings may be commenced by one or more of those persons as representing some or all of them.\n        (2) Representative proceedings may be commenced –\n                (a) whether or not the relief sought –\n                        (i) is, or includes, equitable relief; or\n                        (ii) consists of, or includes, damages; or\n                        (iii) includes claims for damages that would require individual assessment; or\n                        (iv) is the same for each person represented; and\n                (b) whether or not the proceedings –\n                        (i) are concerned with separate contracts or transactions between the defendant in the proceedings and individual group members; or\n                        (ii) involve separate acts or omissions of the defendant done or omitted to be done in relation to individual group members.\n\n67. Standing\n        (1) For the purposes of section 66(1)(a) , a person has a sufficient interest to commence representative proceedings against another person on behalf of other persons if the person has standing to commence proceedings on the persons own behalf against that other person.\n        (2) The person may commence representative proceedings on behalf of other persons against more than one defendant, whether or not the person and each of those persons have a claim against every defendant in the proceedings.\n        (3) If a person has commenced representative proceedings, that person retains standing –\n                (a) to continue the proceedings; and\n                (b) to bring an appeal from a judgment in the proceedings –\n        even though the person ceases to have a claim against any defendant.\n\n68. Consent to be a group member not required\n        (1) Subject to subsection (2) , the consent of a person to be a group member is not required.\n        (2) None of the following is a group member in representative proceedings unless the person gives consent in writing to being so:\n                (a) the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;\n                (b) a Minister of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;\n                (c) a body corporate established for a public purpose by a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, other than an incorporated company or incorporated association;\n                (d) an officer of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, in his or her capacity as an officer.\n\n69.

Originating process\n        (1) The originating process in representative proceedings, or a document filed in support of the originating process, must –\n                (a) describe or otherwise identify the group members to whom the proceedings relate; and\n                (b) specify the nature of the claims made on behalf of the group members and the relief claimed; and\n                (c) specify the question of law or facts common to the claims of the group members; and\n                (d) include any other matters required by the Rules of Court to be included.\n        (2) In describing or otherwise identifying group members for the purposes of subsection (1) , it is not necessary to name, or specify the number of, group members.\n\n71. Right of group member to opt out\n        (1) The Court is to fix a date before which a group member may opt out of representative proceedings in the Court.\n        (2) A group member may opt out of the representative proceedings by written notice given before the date so fixed.\n        (3) The Court may, on application by a group member, the representative party or the defendant in the proceedings, fix another date so as to extend the period during which a group member may opt out of the representative proceedings.\n        (4) Except with the leave of the Court, the hearing of representative proceedings must not commence earlier than the date before which a group member may opt out of the proceedings.\n\n72. Causes of action accruing after commencement of representative proceedings\n        (1) On application by the representative party made at any stage of representative proceedings, the Court may give leave to amend the originating process that commenced the representative proceedings so as to alter the description of the group.\n        (2) The description of the group may be altered so as to include a person –\n                (a) whose cause of action accrued after the commencement of the representative proceedings but before such date as the Court fixes when giving leave under subsection (1) ; and\n                (b) who would have been included in the group, or with the consent of the person would have been included in the group, if the cause of action had accrued before the commencement of the proceedings.\n        (3) The date fixed under subsection (2)(a) may be the date on which leave is given or another date.\n        (4) If the Court gives leave under subsection (1) , it may also make any other orders it thinks just, including an order relating to the giving of notice to persons who, as a result of the amendment, will be included in the group and the date before which such persons may opt out of the proceedings.\n\n73. Situation where fewer than 7 group members\n    If, at any stage of representative proceedings, it appears likely to the Court that there are fewer than 7 group members, the Court, on such conditions (if any) as it thinks fit, may order that the proceedings continue under this Part or order that the proceedings no longer continue under this Part.\n\n74. Distribution costs excessive\n    If –\n            (a) the relief claimed in representative proceedings is or includes payment of money to group members (otherwise than in respect of costs); and\n            (b) on application by the defendant, the Court concludes that it is likely that, if judgment were to be given in favour of the representative party, the cost to the defendant of identifying the group members and distributing to them the amounts ordered to be paid to them would be excessive having regard to the likely total of those amounts –\n    the Court, by order, may direct that the proceedings no longer continue under this Part or stay the proceedings so far as they relate to relief of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) .\n\n75. Court may order discontinuance of proceedings in certain circumstances\n        (1) The Court, on application by the defendant or of its own motion, may order that representative proceedings no longer continue under this Part if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so because –\n                (a) the costs that would be incurred, should the proceedings continue as representative proceedings, are likely to exceed the costs that would be incurred if each group member conducted a separate proceeding; or\n                (b) all the relief sought can be obtained by means of proceedings other than representative proceedings under this Part; or\n                (c) the representative proceedings will not provide an efficient and effective means of dealing with the claims of group members; or\n                (d) a representative party is not able to adequately represent the interests of the group members; or\n                (e) it is otherwise inappropriate that the claims be pursued by means of representative proceedings.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(e) , it is not inappropriate for claims to be pursued by means of representative proceedings merely because the persons identified as group members in relation to the proceedings –\n                (a) do not include all persons on whose behalf those proceedings might have been brought; or\n                (b) are aggregated together for a particular purpose such as a litigation funding arrangement.\n        (3) If the Court dismisses an application under this section, the Court may order that no further application under this section be made by the defendant except with the leave of the Court.\n        (4) Leave for the purposes of subsection (3) may be granted subject to such conditions as to costs as the Court considers just.\n\n76. Effect of discontinuance order under this Part\n        (1) If the Court makes an order under section 73 , 74 or 75 that representative proceedings no longer continue under this Part –\n                (a) the proceedings may be continued as proceedings by the representative party on the partys own behalf against the defendant; and\n                (b) on the application of a person who was a group member for the purposes of the representative proceedings, the Court may order that the person be joined as an applicant in the proceedings.\n        (2) In this section –\n            applicant, in relation to proceedings, includes a claimant or plaintiff in the proceedings.\n\n77. Determination of questions if not all common\n        (1) If it appears to the Court that determination of the question or questions common to all group members will not finally determine the claims of all group members, the Court may give directions in relation to the determination of the remaining questions.\n        (2) In the case of questions common to the claims of some only of the group members, the directions given by the Court may include directions establishing a sub-group consisting of those group members and appointing a person to be the sub-group representative party on behalf of the sub-group members.\n\n78. Individual questions\n        (1) In giving directions under section 77 , the Court may permit an individual group member to appear in the proceedings for the purpose of determining a question that relates only to the claims of that member.\n        (2) In such a case, the individual group member, and not the representative party, is liable for costs associated with the determination of the question.\n\n79. Directions relating to commencement of further proceedings\n    If a question cannot be dealt with properly or conveniently by the Court under section 77 or 78 , the Court may give directions for the commencement and conduct of other proceedings, whether or not representative proceedings.\n\n80. Adequacy of representation\n        (1) If, on application by a group member, it appears to the Court that a representative party is not able to represent the interests of the group members adequately, the Court may substitute another group member as representative party and make such other orders as it thinks fit.\n        (2) If, on application by a sub-group member, it appears to the Court that a sub-group representative party is not able to represent the interests of the sub-group members adequately, the Court may substitute another person as sub-group representative party and may make such other orders as it thinks fit.\n\n81. Stay of execution in certain circumstances\n    If a defendant in representative proceedings commences proceedings in the Court against a group member, the Court may order a stay of execution in respect of any relief awarded to the group member in the representative proceedings until the other proceedings are determined.\n\n82. Approval of Court required for settlement or discontinuance\n        (1) Representative proceedings may not be settled or discontinued without the approval of the Court.\n        (2) If the Court gives such approval, it may make such orders as are just with respect to the distribution of any money, including interest, paid under a settlement or paid into the Court in relation to the representative proceedings.\n        (3) Unless the Court is satisfied that it is just to do so, an application for approval of a settlement of representative proceedings may not be determined unless notice has been given to group members in accordance with section 84 .\n\n83. Settlement of individual claim of representative party\n        (1) A representative party, with the leave of the Court, may settle the partys individual claim in whole or in part at any stage of the representative proceedings.\n        (2) If in representative proceedings the representative party is seeking leave of the Court to settle, or has settled, his or her individual claim, the representative party, with the leave of the Court, may withdraw as representative party.\n        (3) If a person has sought leave to withdraw as representative party under subsection (2) , the Court, on application by a group member, may make an order for the substitution of another group member as representative party and may make such other orders as it thinks fit.\n        (4) Before granting, under subsection (2) , a person leave to withdraw as representative party –\n                (a) the Court must be satisfied that notice of the application has been given to group members in accordance with section 84(1) and has been given in sufficient time for them to apply to have another person substituted as the representative party; and\n                (b) any application for the substitution of another group member as representative party must have been determined.\n\nDivision 3 - Notices\n\n84. Notice to be given of certain matters\n        (1) Notice must be given to group members of the following matters in relation to representative proceedings:\n                (a) the commencement of the proceedings and the right of the group members to opt out of the proceedings before a specified date, being the date fixed under section 71(1) ;\n                (b) an application by the defendant in the proceedings for the dismissal of the proceedings on the ground of want of prosecution;\n                (c) an application for approval of a settlement;\n                (d) an application by a representative party seeking leave to withdraw under section 83 as representative party.\n        (2) The Court may dispense with compliance with any or all of the requirements of subsection (1) if the relief sought in the representative proceedings does not include any claim for damages.\n        (3) If the Court so orders, notice must be given to group members of the paying into Court of money in answer to a cause of action on which a claim in the representative proceedings is founded.\n        (4) The Court, at any stage, may order that notice of any matter be given to a group member or group members.\n        (5) Notice under this section must be given as soon as practicable after the occurrence of the event to which it relates.\n\n85. Notices under section 84\n        (1) The form and content of a notice under section 84 are to be approved by the Court.\n        (2) The Court, by order, is to specify –\n                (a) who is to give the notice; and\n                (b) the way in which the notice is to be given.\n        (3) An order under subsection (2) may also include provisions –\n                (a) directing a party to provide information relevant to the giving of the notice; and\n                (b) relating to the costs of giving the notice.\n        (4) An order under subsection (2) may require that notice be given by –\n                (a) means of press advertisement, radio broadcast or television broadcast; or\n                (b) any other means.\n        (5) The Court may not order that notice be given personally to each group member unless it is satisfied that it is reasonably practicable, and not unduly expensive, to do so.\n        (6) A notice that concerns a matter for which the Courts leave or approval is required must specify the period within which a group member or other person may apply to the Court, or take some other step, in relation to the matter.\n        (7) A notice that includes or concerns conditions must specify the conditions and the period, if any, for compliance.\n        (8) The failure of a group member to receive, or respond to, a notice does not affect a step taken, or an order made or judgment given, in any proceedings.\n\nDivision 4 - Powers of Court\n\n86. Judgment – powers of Court\n        (1) The Court, in determining a matter in representative proceedings, may do any one or more of the following:\n                (a) determine a question of law;\n                (b) determine a question of fact;\n                (c) make a declaration of liability;\n                (d) grant any equitable relief;\n                (e) make an award of damages for group members, sub-group members or individual group members, being damages consisting of specified amounts or amounts calculated in such manner as the Court specifies;\n                (f) make an award of damages in an aggregate amount without specifying amounts awarded in respect of individual group members.\n        (2) In making an award of damages, the Court must make provision for the payment or distribution of the money to the group members entitled.\n        (3) Subject to section 82 , the Court is not to make an award of damages under subsection (1)(f) unless a reasonably accurate assessment can be made of the total amount to which group members will be entitled under the judgment.\n        (4) If the Court has made an award of damages, the Court may give such directions (if any) as it thinks just in relation to –\n                (a) the manner in which a group member is to establish the members entitlement to share in the damages; and\n                (b) the manner in which any dispute regarding the entitlement of a group member to share in the damages is to be determined.\n        (5) A judgment given in representative proceedings is to describe or otherwise identify the group members who will be affected by it.\n\n87. Constitution, &c., of fund\n        (1) Without limiting the operation of section 86 , in making provision for the distribution of money to group members, the Court may provide for –\n                (a) the constitution and administration of a fund consisting of the money to be distributed; and\n                (b) either –\n                        (i) the payment by the defendant of a fixed sum of money into the fund; or\n                        (ii) the payment by the defendant into the fund of such instalments, and on such terms, as the Court directs so as to meet the claims of group members; and\n                (c) entitlements to interest earned on the money in the fund.\n        (2) The costs of administering a fund are to be borne by the fund, or by the defendant in the representative proceedings, or by both, as the Court directs.\n        (3) If the Court orders the constitution of a fund referred to in subsection (1) , the order is to –\n                (a) require notice to be given to group members in such manner as is specified in the order; and\n                (b) specify the manner in which a group member is to make a claim for payment out of the fund and establish the group members entitlement to payment; and\n                (c) specify a day (which is not earlier than 6 months after the day on which the order is made) on or before which the group members are to make a claim for payment out of the fund; and\n                (d) make provision in relation to the day by which the fund is to be distributed to group members who have established an entitlement to be paid out of the fund.\n        (4) The Court may allow a group member to make a claim after the day specified under subsection (3)(c) if –\n                (a) the fund has not already been fully distributed or applied in accordance with an order under subsection (5) ; and\n                (b) it is just to do so.\n        (5) On the application of the defendant made after the day by which the fund is to be distributed to group members, as referred to in subsection (3)(d) , the Court may make such orders as it thinks fit for the payment from the fund to the defendant of the money remaining in the fund.\n\n88. Effect of judgment\n    A judgment given in representative proceedings binds all group members affected by it, other than any person who has opted out of the proceedings under section 71 .\n\nDivision 5 - Appeals\n\n89. Appeals\n        (1) Subject to the Rules of Court and without limiting the application of section 40 , the following appeals from a judgment of the Court in representative proceedings may be brought under that section as representative proceedings:\n                (a) an appeal by the representative party on behalf of group members in respect of a judgment to the extent that it relates to questions common to the claims of the group members;\n                (b) an appeal by a sub-group representative party on behalf of sub-group members in respect of a judgment to the extent that it relates to questions common to the claims of the sub-group members.\n        (2) The parties to an appeal in respect of the determination of a question that relates only to the claim of an individual group member are that group member and the defendant.\n        (3) If the representative party or the sub-group representative party does not institute an appeal within the time allowed for doing so, another member of the group or sub-group may, within a further 21-day period, institute an appeal as representing the group members or sub-group members.\n        (4) If an appeal is brought from the judgment of the Court in representative proceedings, the Court hearing the appeal may direct that notice of the appeal be given to such persons, and in such manner, as it considers appropriate.\n        (5) This Part, other than section 71 , applies to appeal proceedings that relate to representative proceedings despite any other provisions of this Act, the provision of any other Act or any other law.\n        (6) The notice instituting an appeal in relation to questions that are common to the claims of group members or sub-group members must describe or otherwise identify the group members or sub-group members but need not specify the names or number of those members.\n\nDivision 6 - Miscellaneous\n\n89A.

Suspension of limitation periods\n        (1) On the commencement of any representative proceedings, the running of the limitation period that applies to the claim of a group member to which the proceedings relate is suspended.\n        (2) The limitation period does not begin to run again unless –\n                (a) the member opts out of the proceedings under section 71 ; or\n                (b) the proceedings are discontinued; or\n                (c) the proceedings, and any appeals arising from the proceedings, are determined without finally disposing of the group members claim.\n        (3) However, nothing in this section affects the running of a limitation period in respect of a group member who, immediately before the commencement of the representative proceedings, was barred by the expiration of that period from commencing proceedings in the members own right in respect of a claim in the representative proceedings.\n        (4) This section applies despite anything in the Limitation Act 1974 or any other law.\n\n89C.

Charging order to be made ex parte in first instance, and on notice to bank or company to act as a distringas\n    In order to prevent any person against whom judgment shall have been obtained, or an order shall have been made, from transferring, receiving, or disposing of any stock, funds, annuities, securities, or shares hereby authorized to be charged for the benefit of the judgment creditor under the order of a judge, every order of a judge charging any Government stock, funds, or annuities, or any securities of a public authority, or any stock or shares in any public company, under this Act, shall be made in the first instance ex parte, without any notice to the judgment debtor, and shall be an order to show cause only; and such order (if any Government stock, funds, or annuities, or any securities of a public authority standing in the name of the judgment debtor in his own right, or in the name of any person in trust for him, is or are to be affected by such order) shall restrain the officer or person having the registry, control, or management of such stock, funds, annuities, or securities, or of the transfers thereof, from permitting a transfer of such stock, funds, annuities, or securities in the meantime and until such order shall be made absolute or discharged; and (if any stock or shares of or in any public company in this State standing in the name of the judgment debtor in his own right, or in the name of any person in trust for him, is or are to be affected by such order) shall in like manner restrain such public company from permitting a transfer thereof; and if after notice of such order to the person or persons to be restrained thereby, or, in case of any corporation, to any authorized agent of such corporation, and before the same shall be discharged or made absolute, such corporation or person or persons shall permit any such transfer to be made, then and in such case the corporation or person or persons so permitting such transfer shall be liable to the judgment creditor for the value or amount of the property so charged and so transferred, or such part thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy his judgment or the sum ordered to be paid to him; and no disposition of the judgment debtor in the meantime shall be valid or effectual as against the judgment creditor; and further, unless the judgment debtor shall, within a time to be mentioned in such order, show to a judge sufficient cause to the contrary, the said order shall, after proof of notice thereof to the judgment debtor, his attorney, or agent, be made absolute: Provided that any such judge shall, upon the application of the judgment debtor or any person interested, have full power to discharge or vary such order.\n\n168.

Execution of instruments by order of Court\n    Where any person refuses or neglects to comply with any judgment or order of the Court or a judge directing him to execute any conveyance, lease, memorandum of transfer, memorandum of lease, contract, or other assurance, document, or instrument whatsoever or to endorse any negotiable instrument, the Court or any judge thereof may, on such terms and conditions, if any, as may be just, order that such conveyance, lease, memorandum of transfer, memorandum of lease, contract or other assurance, document, or instrument, or negotiable instrument, shall be executed or endorsed by such person as the Court or judge may nominate for that purpose; and in such case the conveyance, lease, memorandum of transfer, memorandum of lease, contract, or other assurance, document, or instrument, or negotiable instrument so executed or endorsed by such person shall operate, and be for all purposes available, as if it had been executed or endorsed by the person originally directed to execute or endorse it.\n\nPART X - Enforcement in Tasmania of Judgments Obtained in Superior Courts in Other Parts of His Majesty's Dominions\n\n170.

Transfer to Court of proceedings in equity where subject-matter exceeds limit of jurisdiction of inferior court\n        (1) If, during the progress of any action or matter pending before an inferior court of civil jurisdiction which has jurisdiction in equity conferred on it within the meaning of this Part, it shall be made to appear to the judge of such court that the subject-matter exceeds the limit in point of amount to which the jurisdiction of such court in equity is limited, it shall not affect the validity of any order already made, but it shall be the duty of such judge to direct the action or matter to be transferred to the Supreme Court, and the whole of the procedure in the said action or matter, when so transferred, shall be regulated by the Rules of Court under this Act: Provided always that it shall be lawful for any party to apply to a judge of the Supreme Court for an order authorizing and directing the action or matter to be carried on and prosecuted in the inferior court notwithstanding such excess, and the judge, if he shall deem it right to summon the other parties or any of them to appear before him for that purpose, after hearing such parties, or in default of the appearance of all or any of them, shall have full power to make such order.\n        (2) The Court or a judge may (if the cause or matter is one which can be proceeded with in a district registry) by the order directing any such transfer, or at any time after the transfer, direct the cause or matter to be proceeded with in any district registry in which the cause or matter can be proceeded with.\n\n182. Inferior court having jurisdiction at law and in equity may grant same relief, and give effect to same defences and counter-claims, as the Court\n        (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any such order-in-council as aforesaid, every inferior court which may after the passing of this Act have jurisdiction at law and in equity shall, as regards all causes of action within its jurisdiction for the time being, have power to grant, and shall grant, in any proceeding before such court, such relief, redress, or remedy, or combination of remedies, either absolute or conditional, and shall in every such action give such and the like effect to every ground of defence or counter-claim, equitable or legal, in as full and ample a manner as might and ought to be done in the like case in the Supreme Court.\n        (2) The jurisdiction of Courts of Requests and of Courts of General Sessions as existing at the commencement of this Act shall not be deemed to include jurisdiction in equity within the meaning of this section or section 183 .\n\n183. Counter-claims in inferior courts, and transfers therefrom\n        (1) Where in any proceeding before any inferior court of civil jurisdiction having jurisdiction at law and in equity within the meaning of this Part any defence or counter-claim of the defendant involves matter beyond the jurisdiction of the inferior court, such defence or counter-claim shall not affect the competence or the duty of the inferior court to dispose of the whole matter in controversy so far as relates to the demand of the plaintiff and the defence thereto, but no relief exceeding that which the inferior court has jurisdiction to administer shall be given to the defendant upon any such counter-claim: Provided always that in such case it shall be lawful for a judge of the Supreme Court, if he shall think fit, on the application of any party to the proceeding, to order that the whole proceeding be transferred from such inferior court to the Supreme Court, and (if the proceeding is one which can be proceeded with in a district registry) the judge may order it to be proceeded with in any district registry in which it can be proceeded with, and in any such case the record in such proceeding shall be transmitted by the Registrar or other proper officer of the inferior court to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, or (if the judge orders the proceeding to be proceeded with in a district registry) to the district registrar at the registry in which the proceeding is to be proceeded with, and the same shall thenceforth be continued and prosecuted in the Supreme Court as if it had been originally commenced therein.\n        (2) The jurisdiction of any such inferior court in cases of counter-claim shall not be excluded by reason –\n                (a) that the counter-claim involves matter not within the local jurisdiction of such inferior court, but within the jurisdiction of any other inferior court of civil jurisdiction of this State;\n                (b) that, where the counter-claim involves more than one cause of action, as to each of which the defendant might have maintained a separate action, each such cause of action being within the jurisdiction of the inferior court, the aggregate amount of the counter-claim exceeds the jurisdiction of the inferior court; or\n                (c) that the counter-claim is for an amount of money exceeding the jurisdiction of the inferior court; provided that the plaintiff does not object in writing (within such time as may be prescribed by Rules of Court ) to the inferior court giving relief exceeding that which such court would have had jurisdiction to administer irrespective of the provisions of this section.\n        (3) In any case where the counter-claim in any action in any such inferior court involves matter which, notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) , is beyond the jurisdiction of such court, the inferior court may, on such terms, if any, as it may think just, either adjourn the hearing of the case or stay execution on the judgment for such time as may be necessary to enable any party to apply to remove the proceedings into the Supreme Court, or to enable the defendant to prosecute in a court of competent jurisdiction an action for the purpose of establishing his counter-claim; and in default of any such application being made, or action brought, the inferior court shall, after the expiration of the time limited, have jurisdiction to hear and determine the whole matter in controversy to the same extent as if the whole matter were within the absolute competence of the inferior court.\n\n184.
