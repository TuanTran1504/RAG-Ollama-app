Duration of authorities\n    Unless it is sooner cancelled, an authority has effect for the period of validity specified in it in accordance with section 11(3)(i) .\n\n13. Variation of authority\n        (1) The chief officer may vary an authority –\n                (a) at any time on the chief officer's own initiative; or\n                (b) on application under subsection (3) .\n        (2) However, a variation cannot be made that has the effect of extending the period of validity of an urgent authority.\n        (3) The principal law enforcement officer for an authorised operation, or any other law enforcement officer on behalf of the principal law enforcement officer, may apply to the chief officer for a variation of authority for any one or more of the following purposes:\n                (a) to extend the period of validity of the authority (except as provided by subsection (2) );\n                (b) to authorise additional or alternative persons to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the operation;\n                (c) to authorise participants in the operation to engage in additional or alternative controlled conduct;\n                (d) to identify additional suspects (to the extent known).\n        (4) More than one application for a variation may be made in respect of the same authority, but no single variation may extend the period of validity of an authority for more than 3 months at a time.\n        (5) An application for a variation of an authority may be made –\n                (a) by means of a written document that is signed by the applicant (a \"formal variation application\"); or\n                (b) if the applicant has reason to believe that the delay caused by making a formal variation application may affect the success of the operation, orally in person or by telephone, fax, email or any other means of communication (an \"urgent variation application\").\n        (6) The chief officer may require the applicant to furnish such information concerning the proposed variation as is necessary for the chief officer's proper consideration of the application.\n        (7) After considering an application for a variation of authority, and any additional information furnished under subsection (6) , the chief officer –\n                (a) may vary the authority in accordance with the application, either unconditionally or subject to conditions; or\n                (b) may refuse the application.\n        (8) Section 10(2) applies to an application for a variation of authority under this section in the same way as it applies to an application for authority under section 10(1) .\n        (9) Without limiting subsection (8) , a variation of authority may not be granted unless the chief officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the variation will not authorise a significant alteration of the nature of the authorised operation concerned.\n        (10) A variation of authority may be granted only –\n                (a) by means of a written document signed by the chief officer (a \"formal variation of authority\"); or\n                (b) if the person granting the variation is satisfied that the delay caused by granting a formal variation of authority may affect the success of the operation, orally in person or by telephone, fax, email or any other means of communication (an \"urgent variation of authority\").\n        (11) The chief officer –\n                (a) must ensure that written notes are kept of the following matters:\n                        (i) the date and time when the variation of authority was granted;\n                        (ii) the identity of the law enforcement officer to whom the variation of authority was granted;\n                        (iii) particulars of the variations to the original authority that are approved under this section; and\n                (b) must, as soon as practicable, prepare and give to the applicant a written document that complies with section 14 .\n\n14. Form of variation of authority\n    A variation of authority must –\n            (a) identify the authorised operation for which the authority is in force; and\n            (b) state the name, and rank or position, of the person granting the variation of authority; and\n            (c) if the application for the variation is made under section 13(3) , state the name of the applicant; and\n            (d) state whether the application is a formal variation application or was an urgent variation application; and\n            (e) state the date and time when the variation of authority is or was granted; and\n            (f) describe the variation having regard to the purposes referred to in section 13(3) in respect of which the application was made.\n\n15. Cancellation of authorities\n        (1) The chief officer may, by order in writing given to the principal law enforcement officer for an authorised operation, cancel the authority at any time and for any reason.\n        (2) Without limiting subsection (1) , the chief officer may cancel an authority for an authorised operation at any time at the request of the principal law enforcement officer for the operation.\n        (3) Cancellation of an authority for a controlled operation takes effect at the time when the order is made or at the later time specified in the order.\n\n16. Effect of authorities\n        (1) While it has effect, an authority for a controlled operation –\n                (a) authorises each law enforcement participant to engage in the controlled conduct specified in the authority in respect of the law enforcement participants; and\n                (b) authorises each civilian participant (if any) to engage in the particular controlled conduct (if any) specified in the authority in respect of that participant; and\n                (c) authorises each participant to engage in that conduct in this jurisdiction or any participating jurisdiction (subject to any corresponding law of that participating jurisdiction).\n        (2) The authority to engage in controlled conduct given to a participant cannot be delegated to any other person.\n\n17. Defect in authority\n    An application for authority or variation of authority, and any authority or variation of authority granted on the basis of such an application, is not invalidated by any defect, other than a defect that affects the application, authority or variation in a material particular.\n\nPART 3 - Conduct of Cross-border Controlled Operations\n\nDivision 1 - Controlled conduct engaged in for purposes of controlled operations authorised by Part 2\n\n18. Protection from criminal responsibility for controlled conduct during authorised operations\n    Despite any other Act or law of this jurisdiction, a participant who engages in conduct (whether in this jurisdiction or elsewhere) in an authorised operation in the course of, and for the purposes of, the operation is not, if engaging in that conduct is an offence, criminally responsible for the offence if –\n            (a) the conduct is authorised by, and is engaged in accordance with, the authority for the operation; and\n            (b) the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit an offence under a law of any jurisdiction or the Commonwealth that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and\n            (c) the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to –\n                    (i) cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or\n                    (ii) involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and\n            (d) if the participant is a civilian participant, he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer.\n\n19. Indemnification of participants against civil liability\n        (1) This section applies to a law enforcement agency if a controlled operation has been authorised by the chief officer of the agency under section 10 .\n        (2) The law enforcement agency must indemnify a participant in the authorised operation against any civil liability (including reasonable costs) that the participant incurs because of conduct that the participant engages in if –\n                (a) the participant engages in the conduct in the course of, and for the purposes of, the operation in accordance with the authority for the operation; and\n                (b) the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit an offence under a law of any jurisdiction or the Commonwealth that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and\n                (c) the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to –\n                        (i) cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or\n                        (ii) involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and\n                (d) if the participant is a civilian participant, he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer; and\n                (e) the requirements (if any) specified in the regulations have been met.\n\n20.

Effect of being unaware of variation or cancellation of authority\n        (1) If an authority for a controlled operation is varied in a way that limits its scope, this Part continues to apply to a participant in the operation as if the authority had not been varied in that way, for so long as the participant –\n                (a) is unaware of the variation; and\n                (b) is not reckless about the existence of the variation.\n        (2) If an authority for a controlled operation is cancelled, this Part continues to apply to a participant in the operation as if the authority had not been cancelled, for so long as the participant –\n                (a) is unaware of the cancellation; and\n                (b) is not reckless about the existence of the cancellation.\n\n22. Protection from criminal responsibility for certain ancillary conduct\n        (1) This section applies to conduct such as aiding and abetting the commission of an offence or of conspiring to commit an offence (\"ancillary conduct\") for which a person may be criminally responsible because it involves conduct engaged in by another person that is controlled conduct for which the other person would (but for section 18 ) be criminally responsible (the \"related controlled conduct\").\n        (2) Despite any other Act or law of this jurisdiction, a person who engages in ancillary conduct that is an offence (whether or not the person is a participant in a controlled operation) is not criminally responsible for the offence if at the time the person engaged in the ancillary conduct he or she believed the related controlled conduct was being engaged in, or would be engaged in, by a participant in an authorised operation.\n\nDivision 2 - Compensation and notification of third parties\n\n23.
