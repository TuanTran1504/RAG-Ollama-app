Calculation of value of fee unit and determination of fee unit adjustment factor\n        (1) . . . . . . . .\n        (2) The Minister is to calculate the value of a fee unit in relation to a financial year in accordance with the following formula:\n        where –\n            F1 is the value in dollars of one fee unit during the relevant financial year;\n            F0 is the value in dollars of one fee unit during the previous financial year as determined in accordance with section 6(3) ;\n            B is the average CPI figure for Hobart in respect of the 4 quarters ending on 31 December immediately preceding the financial year in which the value of a fee unit is to apply;\n            C is the average CPI figure for Hobart in respect of the 4 quarters immediately preceding the 4 quarters referred to in the definition of B ;\n            X is the fee unit adjustment factor, expressed as a decimal, determined under subsection (4) .\n        (3) The value of \"X\" in subsection (2) must be greater than or equal to zero.\n        (4) The Minister is to determine annually an amount, to be known as the fee unit adjustment factor, representing the amount by which the ratio of \"B\" to \"C\" should be adjusted to reflect any matters the Minister considers relevant for the purposes of the fee unit calculation.\n        (5) Where the value of a fee unit calculated in accordance with subsection (2) contains a fraction of a cent that value is to be –\n                (a) rounded up to the nearest cent, if the remainder is 0.5 of a cent or more; or\n                (b) rounded down to the nearest cent, if the remainder is less than 0.5 of a cent.\n\n6. Setting of value of fee unit\n        (1) On or before 1 April in each calendar year, the Minister is to publish in the Gazette notice of –\n                (a) the value of a fee unit, calculated in accordance with section 5 , in respect of the financial year commencing on 1 July in that calendar year; and\n                (b) the fee unit adjustment factor, determined in respect of the financial year in accordance with section 5(4) , that is used in the calculation of the value of the fee unit, together with a brief description of the matters taken into consideration in determining under section 5(4) the fee unit adjustment factor.\n        (2) Section 8 , and section 47(3), (3A), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 apply to a notice published under subsection (1) as if it were regulations within the meaning of that Act.\n        (3) In each financial year, the value of a fee unit in respect of that financial year (the relevant year) is –\n                (a) subject to paragraph (b) , the value of a fee unit specified in the notice that is published under subsection (1) in respect of the relevant year; or\n                (b) the value of a fee unit in respect of the financial year that immediately precedes the relevant year if –\n                        (i) no notice is published under subsection (1) in respect of the relevant year; or\n                        (ii) the notice that is published under subsection (1) in respect of the relevant year is disallowed or rescinded before, or during, the relevant year.\n        (4) For the avoidance of doubt, the disallowance or rescission of a notice published under subsection (1) in respect of a financial year does not affect the validity of a fee collected in respect of that financial year before the disallowance or rescission occurred.\n        (5) A notice under subsection (1) –\n                (a) is a regulation within the meaning of the Subordinate Legislation Committee Act 1969 ; and\n                (b) is not a statutory rule for the purposes of the Rules Publication Act 1953 .\n\n7. Calculation of fee\n        (1) The amount of a fee provided for by an enactment, in respect of a financial year, is to be calculated by multiplying the applicable number of fee units by the value of a fee unit in respect of the financial year as determined in accordance with section 6 .\n        (2) Subject to subsection (3) , the amount of a fee calculated under subsection (1) is to be rounded down to the nearest cent.\n        (3) If an amount of goods and services tax is payable in respect of a fee calculated under subsection (1) –\n                (a) the amount of the fee so calculated is not to be rounded down to the nearest cent in accordance with subsection (2) ; and\n                (b) the sum of the fee so calculated and the amount of goods and services tax payable in respect of the fee is to be rounded down to the nearest cent.\n\n8.
