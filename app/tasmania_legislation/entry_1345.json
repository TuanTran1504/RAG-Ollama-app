  "text": "Appointments Act 1876\n\nAn Act to alter and amend the law as to appointments under powers not exclusive\n[Royal Assent 20 November 1876]\n\nWhereas by deeds, wills, and other instruments, powers are frequently given to appoint real and personal property amongst several objects in such manner that no one of the objects of the power can be excluded, or some one or more of the objects of the power cannot be excluded by the donee of the power from a share of such property, but without requiring a substantial share of such property to be given to each object of the power, or to each object of the power who cannot be excluded: And whereas instruments intended to operate as executions of such powers are frequently invalid in consequence of the donee of the power appointing in favour of some one or more of the objects of the power to the exclusion of the other or others, or some other or others of such objects, and it is expedient to amend the law so as to prevent such intended appointments failing:\n\nBe it therefore enacted by His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and House of Assembly, in Parliament assembled, as follows:\n\n1. Appointments to be valid notwithstanding one or more objects excluded\n    No appointment made on or after 16th July 1830, in exercise of any power to appoint any property, real or personal, amongst several objects, shall be invalid at law or in equity on the ground that any object of such power has been altogether excluded, but every such appointment shall be valid and effectual notwithstanding that any one or more of the objects shall not thereby or in default of appointment take a share or shares of the property subject to such power.\n\n2. Saving\n    Nothing in this Act shall prejudice or affect any provision in any deed, will, or other instrument creating any power, which shall declare the amount or the share or shares from which no object of the power shall be excluded, or some one or more object or objects of the power shall not be excluded.\n\n3. Short title\n    This Act may be cited as the Appointments Act 1876 ."
