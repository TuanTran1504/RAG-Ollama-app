Purposes for which plan approved\n    If the council approves a plan submitted under section 111 –\n            (a) the plan is to be dealt with, and has effect, as provided in Division 2 ; and\n            (b) the council is to state on the plan one of the following purposes for which the plan is approved:\n                    (i) if the plan is submitted under section 111 (1) (a) or (b) for the purpose of enabling the approved lot to form a single parcel;\n                    (ii) if the plan is submitted under section 111 (2) , for the purpose of enabling a purchaser or donee to acquire all the sub-minimum lots which together form the minimum lot shown on the plan;\n                    (iii) if the plan is submitted under section 111 (1) (c) , under both section 111 (1) and (3) or under both section 111 (2) and (3) , firstly for the purpose of enabling the portions of the approved lot to form a single parcel or for enabling a purchaser or donee to acquire all the sub-minimum lots which together are to form the minimum lot, and secondly for the purpose of giving effect to the subdivision under Division 2 .\n\n113.

Exemption\n        (1) The council may exempt a subdivision from the operation of this Part –\n                (a) if it is satisfied that all sub-minimum lots to be subdivided are intended to be added to adjoining lands which are used for grazing, pastoral, agricultural, horticultural or similar purposes; or\n                (b) if, in the opinion of the council, it is unlikely that a sub-minimum lot created by the subdivision would be purchased as the site for a dwelling.\n        (2) If the council exempts a subdivision under subsection (1) , it is to certify the exemption on the plan prepared for the purpose of carrying out the subdivision.\n\nDivision 8 - Public open space\n\n116. Limitation on requirement for public open space\n        (1) If the council –\n                (a) requires an owner to increase the area for public open space so that the value of the total area approved for open space in the final plan exceeds the value of the area provided for open space in the plan of subdivision; or\n                (b) having failed to approve a plan for subdivision on a ground that the layout should be altered to include or omit public open space, subsequently approves a fresh plan in which the value of the total area of land reserved for public open space exceeds the value of all such land in the original plan –\n        and the value of the area reserved for open space in the plan also exceeds the value of one-twentieth of the whole area comprised in the plan of subdivision, the council must purchase the excess as provided in this section.\n        (2) The purchase price of the excess is a sum bearing the same ratio to the value of the total area approved in the final plan as the excess bears to that area.\n        (3) If the owner and the council are unable to agree on the purchase price within 30 days of its demand, it is to be determined as if it were a disputed claim for compensation under the Land Acquisition Act 1993 .\n        (4) The purchase price is due –\n                (a) after the final plan takes effect as provided; and\n                (b) upon demand by the owner accompanied by a conveyance of transfer executed by the owner of the total area mentioned in subsection (1) .\n        (5) The purchase price bears interest at 5% a year from the day 2 months after that on which it is agreed upon or determined until payment.\n        (6) Land is to be valued as at the date of lodgment of the plan of subdivision.\n        (7) The council is required to purchase only so much of the excess land as is required for public open spaces on the basis that the excess is divided between the public open spaces and littoral or riparian reserves in the same proportion as the total area is divided between them.\n        (8) The council is to pay a purchase price as if it were purchasing the whole excess and is entitled to be reimbursed by the Treasurer the difference between the purchase price paid by it and so much of the purchase price as is attributable to the land purchased.\n        (9) If an amount is not agreed, the amount is to be determined as if it were a disputed claim for compensation under the Land Acquisition Act 1993 .\n\n117. Payment instead of increasing public open space\n        (1) Instead of requiring an owner to increase the area for public open space, the council, before approving a plan of subdivision may require security for the payment of an amount calculated under subsection (2) .\n        (1A) A planning scheme –\n                (a) may specify that compliance with a requirement specified in subsection (1) is an acceptable solution in relation to subdivisions; and\n                (b) may enable a permitted development permit to be issued if such an acceptable solution is complied with in relation to a plan of subdivision.\n        (2) The amount required to be paid is an amount not exceeding an amount which bears the same ratio to the value of the whole area comprised in the plan as one-twentieth of that area less any area provided for public open space in the final plan and any area created by the final plan of the littoral or riparian reserve bears to that whole area.\n        (3) If the owner and the council do not agree on the amount to be secured, it is to be determined as a disputed claim for compensation under the Land Acquisition Act 1993 .\n        (4) The security that may be required is –\n                (a) a bond by the owner of an amount in excess of any possible demand to secure payment of the amount within 90 days after the demand is made after the final plan has taken effect; and\n                (b) a guarantee by an authorised deposit-taking institution, a guarantee, money-lending, insurance or trading corporation approved by the council guaranteeing all money payable on the bond.\n        (5) The council is to receive an amount payable under this section on trust for the acquisition or improvement of land for public open space for the benefit of inhabitants of the municipal area.\n        (6) Any amount held, before the commencement of this section, by the council on trust for the acquisition of land for public open space is to be held on trust for the acquisition or improvement of land for public open space and applied in accordance with any prescribed requirements.\n        (7) In respect of any amount paid to the council pursuant to section 473B of the Local Government Act 1962 before the commencement of this section –\n                (a) that amount was lawfully received by the council for the purposes of that section; and\n                (b) no action or legal proceedings may be continued or instituted against any person in respect of the receipt or holding by a council of that amount.\n\nDivision 9 - Miscellaneous matters\n\n118. Council schemes\n        (1) Before the council disposes of lands in circumstances in which, if the disposition were that of a private person the plan would require approval under this Part, it is to prepare a plan of subdivision that it would approve if it were a private person's plan.\n        (2) If a final plan based on a plan of subdivision may be approved by the council if lodged by a private person, the council is to prepare such a final plan and seal it.\n        (3) The provisions of Division 2 apply to a plan sealed in accordance with subsection (2) as nearly as possible as if it were the plan of a private person.\n        (4) A plan sealed under this section is taken to have been approved and sealed under Division 2 .\n\n119.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n120. Savings of contracts\n        (1) Nothing in this Part renders any contract for the disposal of land or instrument of, or affecting, title illegal or void.\n        (2) Every contract for the legal subdivision of land which requires the approval of the council under this Part is taken to have been made subject to the giving of that approval.\n\n121. Application to the Crown\n        (1) This Part binds the Crown as provided in this section.\n        (2) Land may not be disposed of by or on behalf of the Crown unless, if the disposition were that of a private person –\n                (a) it would not require an approval of a plan under this Part; or\n                (b) if it does require such an approval, it is in accordance with a plan which ought reasonably to be approved.\n        (3) Any town land under section 5 of the Crown Lands Act 1976 may not be disposed of unless the Director-General of Lands is of opinion –\n                (a) that the disposition is in accordance with a plan that if it were the subdivision of a private person it ought reasonably to be approved under this Part; or\n                (b) that in the case of a disposition in accordance with a plan prepared before the commencement of this Part, so much of the land in it has already been disposed of that it is unreasonable to alter the plan.\n\n122.

Length of employment\n        (1) For the purposes of this Part, the length of employment is to be calculated from the commencement of continuous service as an employee of one or more councils, and includes –\n                (a) any period of employment in a temporary capacity on probation; and\n                (b) any period of absence on leave, with or without pay; and\n                (c) any period of absence on leave for the purpose of serving as a member of any of Australia's defence forces.\n        (2) If any employee is granted a period of long service leave, whether with or without pay, for any period of or exceeding 90 days, that period is not included as part of the period of employment for the purpose of calculating the long service leave, but that leave is not to be taken as breaking the continuity of employment.\n        (3) If an employee has held any permanent office in another council, and has accepted an office or position in a council directly from the other office, the length of employment is to be calculated from the date on which the employee was permanently appointed to the other office.\n        (4) Any long service leave granted to an employee referred to in subsection (3) while in the employment of the first-mentioned council is taken to have been granted under this section.\n\n229.

Preservation of other rights\n        (1) Any period of long service leave to which an employee is entitled is in addition to any recreation leave or sick leave to which the employee may be entitled under any other enactment.\n        (2) Recreation leave is not, except with the permission of the council, to be granted to an employee under any other enactment in respect of the calendar year in which any period of long service leave granted to that employee under section 227 commences.\n        (3) If recreation leave has been granted to any employee in the calendar year in which any period of long service leave granted to that employee under section 227 commences, that recreation leave, unless the council otherwise directs, is to be regarded as part of the period of long service leave granted to the employee under that section.\n        (4) The period during which an employee is absent on long service leave –\n                (a) is to be included as part of the employee's period of employment; and\n                (b) subject to subsection (1) , is to be taken into account for the purposes of –\n                        (i) determining the salary payable on return to duty; and\n                        (ii) any recreation leave or sick leave to which the employee is entitled under any other enactment.\n\n233. Paid employment on leave prohibited\n        (1) An employee, without the consent of the council, must not while absent on long service leave –\n                (a) engage in any business or undertaking, whether as principal or agent; or\n                (b) engage in the private practice of any profession; or\n                (c) accept, or engage in, any paid employment.\n        (2) If any employee contravenes subsection (1) , the council, by notice in writing may –\n                (a) direct the employee to return to duty, within the period specified in the notice; and\n                (b) require the employee, within the period specified in the notice, to refund such part of any salary or wages paid in advance under section 229 not exceeding the salary or wages for a period equivalent to the then unexpired portion of the long service leave as specified in the notice.\n        (3) Any sum which is required to be refunded by any employee in accordance with subsection (2) is a debt due to the council.\n        (4) If any employee is recalled to duty in pursuance of subsection (2) , the employee is taken to have forfeited all rights and privileges under section 227 up to the date upon which the employee returns to duty.\n        (5) The provisions of this section do not prejudice or affect any punishment or penalty which may be imposed on any employee under any other enactment.\n\n234. Apportionment of expense between councils\n        (1) If the council pays any salary, wages or allowances under this Part, it may recover from any other council in whose employment an employee has served a part of the salary, wages or allowances that is proportionate to the period of employment in that other council in relation to the total period of employment which constitutes the employee's qualification to receive the payment.\n        (2) If an employee becomes entitled to a period of long service leave and has not taken it, the obligation of another council is to be calculated as if the salary, wages or allowance had been paid at the rate at which they would have been paid if the employee had taken the leave as soon as he or she became entitled to it.\n\nDivision 2 - . . . . . . . .\n\n235.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n236.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n237.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n238.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n239.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n240.\n. . . . . . . .\n\nPART 8 - Miscellaneous matters\n\nDivision 1 - Preservation orders\n\n241.
