Application of Commonwealth embryo laws to Tasmania\n        (1) The Commonwealth embryo laws, as in force for the time being and as modified by or under this Act, apply as a law of Tasmania.\n        (2) Those Commonwealth embryo laws so apply as if they extended to matters in relation to which Tasmania may make laws –\n                (a) whether or not the Commonwealth may make laws in relation to those matters; and\n                (b) even though the Commonwealth embryo laws provide that they apply only to specified matters with respect to which the Commonwealth may make laws.\n\n7. Modification of Commonwealth embryo laws\n        (1) The Commonwealth embryo laws are modified for the purposes of this Act by requiring a reference in section 26(2) or 41 of the Commonwealth Embryo Act to the Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction Act 2002 of the Commonwealth to be read as including a reference to the Human Cloning for Reproduction and Other Prohibited Practices Act 2003 of Tasmania.\n        (2) The Commonwealth embryo laws are further modified for the purposes of this Act by omitting paragraph (b) of section 46.\n        (3) The regulations under this Act may also modify the Commonwealth embryo laws for the purposes of this Act.\n        (4) Without limiting subsection (3) , the regulations may provide that the Commonwealth embryo laws apply under section 6(1) as if an amendment to the Commonwealth embryo laws –\n                (a) made by a law of the Commonwealth; and\n                (b) specified in the regulations –\n        had not taken effect.\n\n8. Interpretation of Commonwealth embryo laws\n        (1) The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth –\n                (a) applies as a law of Tasmania in relation to the interpretation of the applied provisions; and\n                (b) so applies as if the applied provisions were a Commonwealth Act or were regulations or other instruments under a Commonwealth Act, as the case requires.\n        (2) The Acts Interpretation Act 1931 of Tasmania does not apply to the applied provisions.\n\nPART 3 - Functions and powers under applied provisions\n\n9.

Object of this Part\n        (1) The object of this Part is to further the object of this Act by providing for an offence against the applied provisions to be treated as if it were an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.\n        (2) The purposes for which an offence is to be treated as mentioned in subsection (1) include, for example (but are not limited to) –\n                (a) the investigation and prosecution of offences; and\n                (b) the arrest, custody, bail, trial and conviction of offenders or persons charged with offences; and\n                (c) proceedings relating to a matter referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) ; and\n                (d) appeals and reviews relating to criminal proceedings and to proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (c) ; and\n                (e) the sentencing, punishment and release of persons convicted of offences; and\n                (f) fines, penalties and forfeitures; and\n                (g) liability to make reparation in connection with offences; and\n                (h) proceeds of crime; and\n                (i) spent convictions.\n\n12.

Functions and powers conferred on Commonwealth officers and authorities relating to offences\n        (1) A Commonwealth law applying because of section 12 that confers on a Commonwealth officer or authority a function or power in relation to an offence against a provision of the Commonwealth embryo laws also confers on the officer or authority the same function or power in relation to an offence against the corresponding provision of the applied provisions.\n        (2) In performing a function or exercising a power conferred by this section, the Commonwealth officer or authority must act as nearly as practicable as the officer or authority would act in performing or exercising the same function or power in relation to an offence against the corresponding provision of the Commonwealth embryo laws.\n\n14. No double jeopardy for offences against applied provisions\n    If –\n            (a) an act or omission is both an offence against the applied provisions and an offence against the Commonwealth embryo laws; and\n            (b) the offender has been punished for that offence under those Commonwealth laws –\n    the offender is not liable to be punished for the offence under the applied provisions.\n\nPART 5 - Administrative laws\n\n15. Application of Commonwealth administrative laws to applied provisions\n        (1) The Commonwealth administrative laws apply as laws of Tasmania to any matter arising in relation to the applied provisions as if those provisions were a law of the Commonwealth and not a law of Tasmania.\n        (2) For the purposes of a law of Tasmania, a matter arising in relation to the applied provisions –\n                (a) is taken to be a matter arising in relation to the laws of the Commonwealth in the same way as if those provisions were a law of the Commonwealth; and\n                (b) is taken not to be a matter arising in relation to the laws of Tasmania.\n        (3) Subsection (2) has effect for the purposes of a law of Tasmania except as provided by the regulations under this Act.\n        (4) Any provision of a Commonwealth administrative law applying because of this section that purports to confer jurisdiction on a federal court is taken not to have that effect.\n        (5) For the purposes of this section, a reference in a provision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 of the Commonwealth (as that provision applies as a law of Tasmania) to the whole or any part of Part IVA of that Act is taken to be a reference to the whole or any part of that Part as it has effect as a law of the Commonwealth.\n\n16. Functions and powers conferred on Commonwealth officers and authorities\n        (1) A Commonwealth administrative law applying because of section 15 that confers on a Commonwealth officer or authority a function or power also confers on the officer or authority the same function or power in relation to a matter arising in relation to the applied provisions.\n        (2) In performing a function or exercising a power conferred by this section, the Commonwealth officer or authority must act as nearly as practicable as the officer or authority would act in performing or exercising the same function or power under the Commonwealth administrative law.\n\nPART 6 - Miscellaneous\n\n17. Things done for multiple purposes\n    The validity of a licence, certificate or other thing issued, given or done for the purposes of the applied provisions is not affected only because it was issued, given or done also for the purposes of the Commonwealth embryo laws.\n\n18. Reference in Commonwealth law to a provision of another law\n    For the purposes of sections 12 and 15 , a reference in a Commonwealth law to a provision of that or another Commonwealth law is taken to be a reference to that provision as applying because of those sections.\n\n19. Fees and other money\n    All fees, penalties, fines and other money that, under the applied provisions, are authorised or directed to be payable by or imposed on any person (but not including an amount ordered to be refunded to another person) must be paid to the Commonwealth.\n\n20.
