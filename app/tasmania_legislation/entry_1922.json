As such, it is in addition to and not in derogation of other laws of the State governing the possession and use of explosives. Nothing in this regulation exempts a person from the need to comply with such other laws. So, for example, a person handling an authorised explosive may also need to hold a permit under the Security-sensitive Dangerous Substances Act 2005 in respect of that handling.\n\n16. How are explosives authorised?\n        (1) The Secretary may authorise an explosive –\n                (a) on the Secretary's own initiative; or\n                (b) on the application of a person in accordance with regulation 112 .\n        (2) However, the Secretary may only authorise an explosive if the Secretary is reasonably satisfied that it –\n                (a) has or could have a legitimate use in Tasmania; and\n                (b) should be available for or tested for such use; and\n                (c) can, with appropriate safeguards, be safely handled.\n        (3) If the Secretary thinks it necessary to do so for a proper consideration of an application under subregulation (1)(b) , the Secretary may require the applicant to –\n                (a) perform, or arrange, further tests of the explosive; and\n                (b) provide the test results to the Secretary.\n        (4) However, a requirement under subregulation (3) does not exempt the applicant or any other person from the other provisions of these regulations as they apply to the testing of the relevant explosive.\n\n17. Determination of applications for authorisations\n        (1) After considering an application under regulation 16(1)(b) to have an explosive authorised, the Secretary may –\n                (a) refuse the application; or\n                (b) approve the application.\n        (2) If the application is refused, the Secretary is to notify the applicant as soon as practicable of –\n                (a) the refusal; and\n                (b) the reason for the refusal; and\n                (c) the right of review.\n        (3) If the application is approved, the Secretary is to do the following as soon as practicable:\n                (a) determine the date on which the authorisation is to take effect (the date of authorisation);\n                (b) notify the applicant of the authorisation and the date of authorisation;\n                (c) make an appropriate entry in the register;\n                (d) publish the authorisation and date of authorisation in the Gazette and in any other way that the Secretary may think fit.\n        (4) The Secretary is also to take the actions referred to in subregulation (3)(a) , (c) and (d) if authorising an explosive on the Secretary's own initiative under regulation 16(1)(a) .\n\n18.

Interpretation\n    In this Part –\n        adequate insurance cover, for blasting, means a current policy of insurance that –\n                (a) is issued by a corporate insurer lawfully carrying on business in Australia; and\n                (b) provides insurance cover of at least $10 million (or a lesser amount that the Secretary may, in an individual case, approve in writing) against liability for any injury to persons or property or the environment that may occur as a result of a negligent act or omission in connection with the blasting;\n        blasting means the firing of explosives in order to –\n                (a) blast rock, earth or solid material; or\n                (b) demolish, destroy, dislodge or damage a structure or other thing, whether on or under land or water;\n        commission, in relation to blasting, means to cause or direct the blasting to take place;\n        general blasting means blasting of the kind referred to in regulation 72(5) ;\n        limited blasting means blasting of the kind referred to in regulation 72(4) ;\n        responsible person, for blasting, means a person who commissions, supervises or carries out the blasting;\n        status, of blasting, means its status in terms of whether it is general blasting or limited blasting;\n        trainee blasting means blasting carried out as part of the requirements of an accredited shot-firing course.\n\n71. Blast insurance\n        (1) Blasting may only be carried out if there is adequate insurance cover in relation to the blasting.\n        (2) If blasting is carried out without adequate insurance cover, the person who commissioned the blasting and the person who carried it out are each guilty of an offence.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 50 penalty units.\n        (3) This regulation does not apply to blasting done by, or on behalf of, the Crown in right of the State.\n\n72. Blasting plans\n        (1) Blasting may only be carried out if there is a valid blasting plan for it.\n\n                Note\n            For the validity of blasting plans – see regulation 74 .\n        (2) If blasting is carried out without a valid blasting plan, the person who commissioned the blasting and the person who carried it out are each guilty of an offence.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 50 penalty units.\n        (3) A blasting plan may be –\n                (a) a limited blasting plan; or\n                (b) a general blasting plan.\n        (4) A limited blasting plan is appropriate for –\n                (a) one discrete blast; or\n                (b) a set of blasts, in one location, not extending beyond one day; or\n                (c) trainee blasting.\n        (5) A general blasting plan is appropriate for the kind of multiple or repetitive blasting (possibly occurring over an extended period) that is typically associated with the operation of a mine, a large commercial quarry or road construction works and where a requirement to prepare blasting plans for each discrete blast would be inefficient and onerous in regulatory and commercial terms.\n        (6) However, nothing in this regulation is to be taken as preventing a person from preparing, in respect of blasting that is to be carried out over a period of more than one day, a series of limited blasting plans for each of those days.\n\n73.
