Discharge of obligations\n        (1) A person who has a safety obligation must discharge that obligation.\n        Penalty: If –\n                (a) the contravention causes multiple deaths and serious harm to property or the environment – a fine not exceeding 10 000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years; or\n                (b) the contravention causes multiple deaths – a fine not exceeding 8 000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 4 years; or\n                (c) the contravention causes death or serious personal injury – a fine not exceeding 6 000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years; or\n                (d) the contravention involves exposure to a substance likely to cause death or serious personal injury or illness – a fine not exceeding 4 000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years; or\n                (e) the contravention causes minor personal injury or serious harm to property or the environment – a fine not exceeding 2 000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months; or\n                (f) if paragraphs (a) , (b) , (c) , (d) and (e) of the penalty under this subsection do not apply – a fine not exceeding 1 000 penalty units.\n        (2) However, if –\n                (a) a person is alleged to have contravened subsection (1) ; and\n                (b) it is alleged that the safety obligation the person failed to discharge is the obligation to comply with this Act; and\n                (c) the specific provision of this Act that the failure relates to provides a penalty for contravening that specific provision; and\n                (d) a circumstance of aggravation mentioned in paragraph (a) , (b) , (c) , (d) or (e) of the penalty under subsection (1) is not proved for the alleged offence –\n        the maximum penalty that can be imposed for the alleged offence is the monetary penalty for that specific provision.\n        (3) In this section –\n            minor personal injury means bodily injury that interferes with health or comfort;\n            multiple deaths means the death of 2 or more people;\n            serious personal injury means injury that –\n                    (a) results in the full or partial loss of a distinct part or organ of the body or of the use of a distinct part or organ of the body; or\n                    (b) results in serious disfigurement; or\n                    (c) if left untreated, would endanger or be likely to endanger life, or cause or be likely to cause permanent injury to health –\n            whether or not treatment is or could have been available.\n\n12. Obligations may be owed in more than one capacity\n    A person who has a safety obligation in one capacity may have the same or another safety obligation in another capacity.\n\n13. Obligations are owed even if others also have them\n    To avoid doubt, it is declared that the imposition of a safety obligation on one person does not relieve another person of a safety obligation that the other person may have.\n\n14. How to discharge obligations if there are regulations or approved codes of practice\n        (1) If the regulations prescribe a way of achieving an acceptable level of risk, a person may discharge the person's safety obligation regarding the risk only by following the prescribed way.\n        (2) If the regulations prohibit exposure to a risk, a person may discharge the person's safety obligation regarding the risk only by ensuring that the prohibition is not contravened.\n        (3) Subject to subsections (1) and (2) , if an approved code of practice states a way of achieving an acceptable level of risk, a person may discharge the person's safety obligation regarding the risk only by –\n                (a) adopting and following the stated way; or\n                (b) adopting and following another way that achieves a level of risk equal to or lower than the acceptable level.\n\n15. How to discharge obligations if there are no regulations or approved codes of practice\n        (1) This section applies if there is no regulation or approved code of practice prescribing or stating a way to discharge a person's safety obligation regarding a risk.\n        (2) The person may choose an appropriate way to discharge the person's safety obligation regarding the risk.\n        (3) However, the person discharges the person's safety obligation regarding the risk only if the person takes reasonable precautions, and exercises proper diligence, to ensure that the obligation is discharged.\n\nDivision 2 - Obligations of occupiers and others\n\n16.
