Short title\n    This Act may be cited as the Minors Contracts Act 1988 .\n\n2. Commencement\n    This Act shall commence on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.\n\n3. Interpretation\n    In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears â€“\n        minor means a person under 18 years of age;\n        relevant date means the date on which a minor enters into a contract.\n\n4. Enforceability of minors contracts against guarantors in certain cases\n        (1) Where a person, other than a minor, guarantees the performance by a minor of his obligations under any contract, the guarantee is enforceable against the guarantor to the same extent as if the minor had not been a minor at the relevant date.\n        (2) This section does not operate to render a guarantee enforceable if it would, apart from this section, be unenforceable otherwise than by reasons of the minority of the person whose obligations are guaranteed.\n\n5.
