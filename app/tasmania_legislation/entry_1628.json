his remuneration in that employment for the relevant period is the average rate of the remuneration received by him in that employment during the period of 3 months ending on the commencement of that period.\n        (4) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) , where no ordinary rate of remuneration is fixed for an employee's work under the terms of his employment, the rate of his remuneration in that

disability allowance is any allowance payable to an employee as a consequence of his working in specified circumstances, being circumstances that involve, or are likely to involve, special danger,

employee is ordinarily engaged would be entitled to that allowance for the whole, or the greater portion, of the time in which they are so engaged.\n        (8) The cash value of any board or lodging provided for an employee shall be deemed to be that fixed by or under the terms of his employment or, if it is not so fixed, shall be computed at such rate as may be agreed between the employer and employee or determined by the Secretary on the application of either of them.\n        (9) In the computation of the ordinary pay of an employee for a period for the purposes of section 9 or for the purposes of section 12 (4) , any variation in the terms of his employment that would have come into effect during that period if he had remained in his employment shall be disregarded.\n\n12.

Interpretation\n            (1) In this Schedule –\n                employee means an employee who is not a mining employee;\n                intermediate continuing employee, of an employer, means an employee who, immediately before the 2011 transition day, had been in continuous employment with the employer for 9 or more years, but less than 12 years;\n                long-term continuing employee, of an employer, means an employee who, immediately before the 2011 transition day, had been in continuous employment with the employer for 12 or more years;\n                new continuing employee, of an employer, means an employee who, immediately before the 2011 transition day, had been in continuous employment with the employer for less than 9 years;\n                new long service leave entitlements means the long service leave entitlements available to and in respect of employees under this Act as amended by the Long Service Leave Amendment Act 2011 ;\n                old long service leave entitlements means the long service leave entitlements available to and in respect of employees under this Act immediately before the 2011 transition day;\n                2011 transition day means the day on which the Long Service Leave Amendment Act 2011 commences;\n                2011 transition period means the 12-month period commencing on the 2011 transition day.\n            (2) This Schedule prevails over section 8(2) and section 9(2) .\n    2. Transitional arrangements\n            (1) In their application to a new continuing employee or long-term continuing employee of an employer, the new long service entitlements take effect in all respects on the 2011 transition day.\n            (2) In their application to an intermediate continuing employee of an employer, the new long service entitlements take effect on the 2011 transition day, including the entitlements under section 9(2) , but the intermediate continuing employee may not actually take or be granted long service leave under the new long service leave entitlements before the 2011 transition period expires.\n            (3) However, nothing in subclause (2) is to be taken as preventing an intermediate continuing employee of an employer from applying, during the 2011 transition period, for long service leave under the new long service leave entitlements if the application is in respect of long service leave that would be taken after the 2011 transition period expires.\n            (4) To avoid doubt, an employee who has exhausted his or her old long service leave entitlements in respect of any period of continuous employment is not entitled to any further long service leave in respect of that period of continuous employment (or any part of it) under the new long service entitlements."
