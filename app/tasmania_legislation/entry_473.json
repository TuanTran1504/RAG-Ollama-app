  "text": "Vehicle and Traffic (Vehicle Standards) Regulations 2014\n\nI, the Lieutenant-Governor in and over the State of Tasmania and its Dependencies in the Commonwealth of Australia, acting with the advice of the Executive Council make the following regulations under the Vehicle and Traffic Act 1999 .\n\n18 June 2014\n\nA. M. BLOW\n\nLieutenant-Governor\n\nBy His Excellency's Command,\n\nM. T. (Rene) HIDDING\n\nMinister for Infrastructure\n\nPART 1 - Preliminary\n\nDivision 1 - Short title and commencement\n\n1. Short title\n    These regulations may be cited as the Vehicle and Traffic (Vehicle Standards) Regulations 2014 or the Vehicle Standards.\n\n2. Commencement\n    These regulations take effect on 1 July 2014.\n\nDivision 2 - Vehicle Standards and offences\n\n3. Vehicle Standards\n    These regulations –\n            (a) prescribe vehicle standards for Tasmania; and\n            (b) are referred to, collectively, within these regulations as the Vehicle Standards.\n               Note The Vehicle Standards set standards that vehicles must comply with to be driven on public streets.     The Australian Design Rules (ADRs) - see Division 1 of Part 3 - are rules for designing and building vehicles. Imported vehicles must also comply with the ADRs.     The Vehicle Standards require a vehicle that is subject to an ADR when built or imported to continue to comply with the ADR.     The Vehicle Standards also apply certain other standards (adopted standards) that are intended to complement the ADRs.     The ADRs do not cover:       vehicles built before 1969;       combinations of vehicles of any age; or       every safety feature for vehicles built between 1969 and 1988.     Those matters are covered by the Vehicle Standards and dimension limits for vehicles are set out in the Vehicle and Traffic (Vehicle Operations) Regulations 2014 .     In most cases, if a vehicle complies with the Vehicle Standards and the Vehicle and Traffic (Vehicle Operations) Regulations 2014 it is suitable for use on public streets.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n    4. Vehicle Standards offences\n            (1) Except as provided by this regulation, a person must not use, or cause or permit the use of, a vehicle or combination on a public street unless –\n                    (a) the vehicle or combination complies with each provision of the Vehicle Standards applying to the vehicle or combination; and\n                    (b) the vehicle or combination, and each part of the vehicle or combination and its equipment, is in a safe and roadworthy condition; and\n                    (c) each light, reflector, sign, writing, colouring or band required to be fitted, lit or displayed on the vehicle or combination under the Vehicle Standards is clean and unobscured.\n            Penalty: Fine not exceeding 20 penalty units.\n            (2) Subregulation (1)(a) does not apply to a vehicle or combination if –\n                    (a) it is used on a public street under one of the following authorisations:\n                            (i) a permit issued by the Commission under Part 7 of the Vehicle and Traffic (Vehicle Operations) Regulations 2014 ;\n                            (ii) a short term unregistered vehicle permit issued under the Vehicle and Traffic (Driver Licensing and Vehicle Registration) Regulations 2021 ;\n                            (iii) a conditional registration under the Vehicle and Traffic (Driver Licensing and Vehicle Registration) Regulations 2021 ;\n                            (iv) an exemption under section 28 or 29 of the Vehicle and Traffic Act 1999 ;\n                            (v) an exemption, approval or determination issued by the Registrar under the Vehicle and Traffic Act 1999 ; and\n                    (b) the authorisation excuses or has the effect of excusing the vehicle or combination from having to comply with the applicable provision of the Vehicle Standards; and\n                    (c) the vehicle or combination is being used in accordance with the authorisation.\n            (3) Subregulation (1)(a) does not apply to or in relation to the failure of a motor vehicle's emission control system to comply with applicable provisions of the Vehicle Standards if, despite the non-compliance, the system is continuing to operate essentially in accordance with its original design.\n            (4) It is a defence in proceedings under subregulation (1)(a) to show that, at the relevant time, the vehicle or combination failing to comply with an applicable provision of the Vehicle Standards was –\n                    (a) being repaired, or being tested in the course of being repaired, so that it would comply with the Vehicle Standards; and\n                    (b) not endangering its occupants or other road users while being so repaired or tested.\n\n    Division 3 - Some features of the Vehicle Standards\n\n    5. Definitions and dictionary\n            (1) The dictionary in Part 15 defines certain words and expressions, and includes signpost definitions to words and expressions defined elsewhere in the Vehicle Standards.\n            (2) A definition in the Vehicle Standards applies to each use of the word or expression in the Vehicle Standards, unless the contrary intention appears.\n\n    6. Diagrams\n            (1) A diagram in the Vehicle Standards is part of the Vehicle Standards.\n            (2) A diagram of something is an illustrative example of the thing in black and white, but does not represent its dimensions or the dimensions of any part of it.\n\n    7. Notes\n        A note in the Vehicle Standards is explanatory and is not part of the Vehicle Standards.\n\n    8. Examples\n            (1) An example, whether or not in the form of a diagram, in the Vehicle Standards is part of the Vehicle Standards.\n            (2) If the Vehicle Standards include an example of the operation of a provision of the Vehicle Standards –\n                    (a) the example is not exhaustive; and\n                    (b) the example does not limit, and may extend, the meaning of the provision; and\n                    (c) the example and the provision are to be read in the context of each other and of the other provisions of the Vehicle Standards, but, if the example and the provision as so read are inconsistent, the provision prevails.\n\n    PART 2 - Application of Vehicle Standards\n\n    9. Application to vehicles and combinations on public streets\n            (1) Subject to subregulation (2) , the Vehicle Standards apply to light vehicles and light combinations on public streets.\n            (2) Part 1, regulation 43(5) and (6) , regulation 46(3) , (4) and (5) , Division 18 of Part 8 , Part 13 and Part 15 apply to –\n                    (a) light vehicles and light combinations on public streets; and\n                    (b) heavy vehicles and heavy combinations on public streets.\n\n    10. Vehicles to which Vehicle Standards do not apply\n        The Vehicle Standards do not apply to a vehicle designed to be controlled by a person walking next to it.\n        Note Also, the Vehicle Standards do not apply to vehicles that are specifically excluded from the definitions of motor vehicle and trailer in section 3(1) of the Vehicle and Traffic Act 1999 .\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        \n\n        11. Non-application of Vehicle Standards: exemption under other laws\n                (1) A provision of the Vehicle Standards does not apply to a vehicle or combination if the vehicle or combination is exempt from –\n                        (a) the provision under another law of this jurisdiction; or\n                        (b) the corresponding provision of the law of another jurisdiction.\n                (2) However, the vehicle or combination is exempt only if all conditions of the exemption, if any, are being complied with.\n\n        12. Non-application of Vehicle Standards: inconsistent ADR requirements\n                (1) A provision of Parts 5 to 13 of the Vehicle Standards does not apply to a vehicle if –\n                        (a) the provision is inconsistent with a requirement of a second or third edition ADR applying to the vehicle; and\n                        (b) the vehicle complies with the requirement.\n                (2) Subregulation (1) does not apply if the vehicle is not of the same class or type as the vehicles to which the ADR requirements apply.\n                   Example:     As the second or third edition ADR do not apply to a truck built in 1968, the truck must comply with regulation 118. If the owner of such a truck modified the brakes so that they did comply with the second edition ADR, any requirement in regulation 118 in relation to the trucks brakes that was inconsistent with the second edition ADR would no longer apply to the truck. However, if the modified brakes only comply with a rule of the second edition ADR that only applies to passenger cars, then regulation 118 does apply, as subregulation (1) would not apply as a result of subregulation (2), because a truck is not a passenger car.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n                \n\n            13. Non-application of Vehicle Standards: Motor Vehicle Standards Act approvals\n                A provision of Parts 5 to 13 of the Vehicle Standards does not apply to a vehicle if –\n                        (a) the vehicle does not comply with a requirement of an ADR applying to the vehicle; and\n                        (b) the provision of the Vehicle Standards corresponds to the requirement of the ADR; and\n                        (c) despite the non-compliance –\n                                (i) approval was given, under section 10A(2) or (3) of the MVSA, to place an identification plate on that vehicle; or\n                                (ii) approval was given under item 4(2) or 6(2) of Schedule 3 to the Road Vehicle Standards (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2018 of the Commonwealth; or\n                                (iii) the vehicle satisfied the requirements of an entry pathway under section 15(2) of the RVSA and the vehicle is entered on the RAV; and\n                        (d) the vehicle complies with the approval conditions, if any.\n                           Note 1 Section 10A(2) of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 of the Commonwealth deals with vehicles that do not comply with an ADR, but the non-compliance is only in minor and inconsequential respects.     Note 2 Section 10A(3) of that Act deals with vehicles that do not comply with an ADR, and the non-compliance is not minor and inconsequential, but the vehicle will be safe to use if conditions are complied with.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n                        \n\n                PART 3 - Australian Design Rules\n\n                        Note 1\n                    This Part applies the second and third edition ADRs to various vehicles.\n\n                        Note 2\n                    Under this Part, a vehicle that is subject to ADRs when it is built generally remains subject to the ADRs throughout its life. However, a vehicle need not comply with a standard if the standard is replaced by, or is inconsistent with, a later standard and the vehicle complies with the later standard. Older vehicles may, therefore, be fitted with any equipment allowed on newer vehicles.\n\n                        Note 3\n                    Vehicles that are modified must continue to comply with the Vehicle Standards. Modifications to a heavy vehicle must be undertaken in accordance with Vehicle Standards Bulletin 6 (VSB 6). Modifications to a light vehicle must be undertaken in accordance with Vehicle Standards Bulletin 14 (VSB 14).\n\n                        Note 4\n                    The following provisions of the Vehicle Standards apply to a vehicle instead of the corresponding ADR requirement:\n                    regulation 36(2) (horns and alarms);\n                    regulation 47 (5) (window tinting);\n                    regulation 54 (tyre speed category requirements);\n                    regulation 104 (fitting of warning lights and signs);\n                    regulation 107(4) (other lights and reflectors).\n\n                Division 1 - Interpretation\n\n                14. What is an ADR\n                    An ADR (Australian Design Rule) is –\n                            (a) a second edition ADR; or\n                            (b) a third edition ADR.\n\n                15.\n                . . . . . . . .\n\n                16. References to national standards\n                    Unless the contrary intention appears, a reference in the Vehicle Standards to an ADR is a reference to the ADR as in force from time to time.\n\n                17. What is a second edition ADR\n                    A second edition ADR is a national standard incorporated in the document described as the Australian Design Rules for Motor Vehicle Safety, Second Edition originally published by the then Commonwealth Department of Transport.\n\n                18.

The actual test will result in a graph that has more variation than the graph below, because of the need to change gears when accelerating. Modes B-D and E-G and H-I have no specific time interval. All the specified time periods have an error margin of ± 1 second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                            Steps    1.  Secure the vehicle on the dynamometer.  2.  Set the dynamometer to simulate the correct load and inertia for the vehicle.  3.  Start sampling.  4.  Idle for 60 seconds.  5.  Accelerate rapidly to 80 km/h under simulated inertia, using wide open throttle, making gear changes as needed for smooth acceleration.  6.  Decelerate by removing all pressure from the accelerator pedal, disengaging the gears and gently applying brakes to bring the vehicle to a standstill.  7.  Idle for 10 seconds.  8.  Accelerate rapidly to 80 km/h under simulated inertia, using wide open throttle, making gear changes as needed for smooth acceleration.  9.  Decelerate by removing all pressure from the accelerator pedal, disengaging the gears and gently applying brakes to bring the vehicle to a standstill.  10.  Idle for 10 seconds.  11.  Accelerate rapidly to 80 km/h under simulated inertia, using wide open throttle, making gear changes as needed for smooth acceleration.  12.  Keep speed at 80 km/h for 60 seconds, then stop sampling and bring the vehicle to rest.  Note: Explanation of the test procedure.     This test has been designed to evaluate vehicle emissions during typical 'real-world' operating modes and conditions. There are 3 simple modes –        3 idle periods;        acceleration to 80 km/h 3 times;        keep speed at 80 km/h.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The driver selects the most appropriate gear change points for the vehicle being tested to achieve the correct speed.     The vehicle's rolling resistance (based on tyre and bearing losses, frontal area and drag coefficient) must also be calculated and continuously factored into the dynamometer tractive effort calculations to ensure correct loading.     Empirical algorithms, based on the vehicle test mass, GVM or other known parameters, may be used to automatically calculate realistic coefficients for the variable.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The vehicle is accelerated rapidly to 80 km/h 3 times by applying wide open throttle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                            \n\n                                                                                            Division 2 -
