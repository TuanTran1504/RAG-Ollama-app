  "text": "Mines Work Health and Safety (Supplementary Requirements) Act 2012\n\nAn Act to establish certain requirements, in respect of health and safety in relation to mines, that are additional to the requirements established by or under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012\n[Royal Assent 6 December 2012]\n\nBe it enacted by His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and House of Assembly, in Parliament assembled, as follows:\n\nPART 1 - Preliminary\n\n1. Short title\n    This Act may be cited as the Mines Work Health and Safety (Supplementary Requirements) Act 2012 .\n\n2. Commencement\n    This Act commences on the day on which the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 commences.\n\n3. Object of Act\n    The object of this Act is to assist in securing the health and safety of mine workers, and other people exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from mining operations, through the implementation of health and safety measures, specific to mines and mining operations, that are in addition to, or in substitution of, the measures imposed under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 .\n\n4. Incorporation of Act into Work Health and Safety Act 2012\n        (1) This Act is to be incorporated in, and read together with, the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 as a single Act and accordingly –\n                (a) subject to subsection (2) , words and expressions that are used in this Act or regulations made under this Act and that are defined in the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 have, unless the contrary intention appears, the same respective meanings; and\n                (b) a reference in the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 to \"this Act\" includes, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to this Act and any regulations made under this Act; and\n                (ba) a reference in any regulations made under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 to these regulations includes, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to any regulations made under this Act; and\n                (c) a reference in any regulations made under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 to \"the Act\" includes, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to this Act and any regulations made under this Act; and\n                (d) a reference in any regulations made under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 to a matter \"under the Act\" includes, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to any regulations made under this Act.\n\n        Note For example, section 191 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 relates to the issuing of an improvement notice in respect of a contravention of the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (by reference to this Act). As a result of subsection (1)(b), an improvement notice may also be issued in respect of the Mines Work Health and Safety (Supplementary Requirements) Act 2012 as the reference in section 191 to this Act now includes both Acts.\n        (2) Despite subsection (1)(a) , words that are used in this Act and that are defined in Part 2 are, in this Act, to be taken to have the meaning they have in this Act.\n        (3) Despite subsection (1) –\n                (a) a reference in this Act to this Act is not to be taken to be a reference to the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 ; and\n                (b) a reference in any regulations made under this Act to these regulations is not to be taken to be a reference to any regulations made under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 .\n\nPART 2 - Interpretative Provisions\n\n5.
