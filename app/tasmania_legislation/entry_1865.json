and\n                (b) shall, subject to subsection (8) , be deemed to be entitled under the remission regulations to any remission of his translated sentence for which, up to the time of his transfer to Tasmania, he was eligible in respect of that translated sentence in the participating State (including any remission of sentence deemed by an interstate law to have been earned in a participating State) and any further remission of sentence under the remission regulations shall be calculated from the time of the arrival of the person in Tasmania.\n        (8) Any remission of a translated sentence –\n                (a) for which the person who is subject to the sentence was eligible up to the time of the person's transfer to Tasmania; and\n                (b) which is attributable to a part of the sentence not served or not to be served in the participating State from which the person was transferred –\n        shall not be taken into account for the purposes of subsection (7) (b) .\n        (9) Subsection (6) does not apply in relation to a conviction or transferred sentence referred to in section 24 (2) (a) or (b) of the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983 of the Commonwealth, but nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the Queen or the Governor from exercising the royal prerogative of mercy as referred to in section 24 (2) of that Act .\n\n27.
