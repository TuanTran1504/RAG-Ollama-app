Effect of declared rights and liabilities\n        (1) A right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 6 –\n                (a) is exercisable or enforceable; and\n                (b) is to be regarded as always having been exercisable or enforceable –\n        as if it were a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by a judgment of the Supreme Court.\n        (2) Without limiting section 6 or subsection (1) of this section, the rights and liabilities conferred, imposed or affected by section 6 include the right of a person who was a party to the proceeding or purported proceeding in which the ineffective judgment was given or recorded to appeal against that judgment.\n        (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) , each ineffective judgment of –\n                (a) the Federal Court of Australia, otherwise than as a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia; or\n                (b) the Family Court of Australia, otherwise than as a Full Court of the Family Court of Australia –\n        is taken to be a judgment of the Supreme Court.\n\n8. Effect of things done or omitted to be done under or in relation to rights and liabilities\n        (1) Any act or thing done or omitted to be done before or after the commencement of this section under or in relation to a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 6 –\n                (a) has the same effect, and gives rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law; and\n                (b) is to be regarded as always having had the same effect, and given rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law –\n        as if it were done, or omitted to be done, to give effect to, or under the authority of, or in reliance on, a judgment of the Supreme Court.\n        (2) For the purposes of an enforcement law, any act or thing done or omitted to be done before or after the commencement of this section gives rise to the same consequences, and is to be regarded as always having given rise to the same consequences, as if each ineffective judgment were a valid judgment of the Supreme Court given in or in relation to the proceeding in or in relation to which the ineffective judgment was given or recorded.\n        (3) In this section,\n            enforcement law means a provision of a law (other than a law relating to contempt of court) that sets out a consequence for a person if the person –\n                    (a) contravenes; or\n                    (b) acts in a specified way while there is in force –\n        a judgment, or a particular kind of judgment, given by a court.\n\n9. Section 6 regarded as having ceased to have effect in certain cases\n        (1) If –\n                (a) before the commencement of this section, a court gave or recorded an ineffective judgment (\"the new judgment\") on the basis that an earlier ineffective judgment (\"the earlier judgment\") was or might be of no effect; and\n                (b) the new judgment replaced the earlier judgment –\n        section 6 has no effect in respect of the earlier judgment.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) , the new judgment replaced the earlier judgment if the new judgment –\n                (a) purportedly conferred or imposed rights or liabilities similar to or different from those purportedly conferred or imposed by the earlier judgment; or\n                (b) purportedly affected rights or liabilities in a way similar to or different from the way in which they were purportedly affected by the earlier judgment.\n\n10. Powers of Supreme Court in relation to declared rights and liabilities\n        (1) The Supreme Court may vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 6 as if it were a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by the Supreme Court in or in relation to proceedings of the kind in or in relation to which the ineffective judgment was given or recorded.\n        (2) In addition to its powers under subsection (1) , the Supreme Court also has power to give a judgment achieving any other result that could have been achieved if –\n                (a) the ineffective judgment had been a valid judgment of the Supreme Court given in or in relation to proceedings of the kind in or in relation to which the ineffective judgment was given or recorded; and\n                (b) the Supreme Court had been considering whether –\n                        (i) to vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend that judgment; or\n                        (ii) to extend the time for the doing of any thing; or\n                        (iii) to grant a stay of proceedings.\n\n11.

Proceedings for contempt\n    If, before or after the commencement of this section, a person has –\n            (a) interfered with a right conferred or affected by section 6 ; or\n            (b) failed to satisfy or comply with a liability imposed or affected by section 6 –\n    the interference or failure is, and is deemed always to have been, a matter that can be dealt with in the same manner as if the interference or failure had been in relation to a right conferred or affected, or a liability imposed or affected, by an order of the Supreme Court.\n\n13. Evidentiary\n    A federal court record, or a copy of a federal court record, of an ineffective judgment may be adduced in evidence to show the existence, nature and extent of each right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 6 .\n\n14.
