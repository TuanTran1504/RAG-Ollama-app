Contribution between tortfeasors\n        (1) Where an action is brought against a person in respect of any damage nothing in this Act shall be taken to prejudice or affect the operation of the Wrongs Act 1954 in relation to an action for contribution in respect of that damage.\n        (2) In this section damage has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of the Wrongs Act 1954 .\n\n8. Shipping\n        (1) Section 4(1) applies to an action to recover seamen's wages, but otherwise the foregoing provisions of this Division do not apply to a cause of action within the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Courts of this State that is enforceable in rem.\n        (2) An action to enforce a claim or lien against a vessel or her owners in respect of damage or loss to another vessel, her cargo or freight, or any property on board her, or damage for loss of life or personal injuries suffered by any person on board her, caused by the fault of the former vessel, whether that vessel be wholly or partly in fault, shall not be brought after the expiration of 2 years from the date on which the damage, loss, or injury was caused.\n        (3) An action to enforce a claim or lien in respect of any salvage services shall not be brought after the expiration of 2 years from the date on which the services were rendered.\n        (4) For the purposes of an action in a court, the court may extend the period mentioned in subsection (2) or subsection (3) to such extent and on such terms as it thinks fit, and shall, if it is satisfied that there has not, within that period, been a reasonable opportunity of arresting the defendant vessel within the jurisdiction of the court, or within the territorial waters of the country to which the plaintiff's vessel belongs or in which the plaintiff resides or has his principal place of business, extend that period to an extent sufficient to give a reasonable opportunity of so arresting the defendant vessel.\n        (5) A period may be extended under this section notwithstanding that it has expired.\n        (6) In this section –\n            freight includes passage money and hire;\n            vessel means a vessel used in navigation, other than air navigation, and includes a barge, lighter, or like vessel,\n        and a reference in this section to damage or loss caused by the fault of a vessel extends to any salvage or other expenses, consequent upon that fault, recoverable at law by way of damages.\n        (7) Part III does not apply to a cause of action to which subsection (2) or subsection (3) applies.\n\n9. Claims in equity\n    This Division does not apply to any claim for specific performance of a contract or for an injunction or for other equitable relief, except in so far as any provision thereof may be applied by analogy in like manner as the corresponding enactment repealed by, or ceasing to have effect in this State by virtue of, this Act has heretofore been applied.\n\nDivision 3 - Actions in respect of land, rent, money secured by charges, trust property, &c.\n\n10.

Provisions in case of settled land and land on trust\n        (1) Subject to section 24(1) , the provisions of this Act apply to equitable interests in land, including interests in the proceeds of sale of land held on trust for sale, in like manner as they apply to legal estates; and accordingly a right of action to recover the land shall, for the purposes of this Act, but not otherwise, be deemed to accrue to a person entitled in possession to such an equitable interest in the like manner and circumstances and on the same date as it would accrue if his interest were a legal estate in the land.\n        (2) Where the period prescribed by this Act has expired for the bringing of an action to recover land by the legal owner of settled land his legal estate therein is not extinguished so long as the right of action to recover the land of any person entitled to a beneficial interest therein either has not accrued or has not been barred by this Act; and the legal estate accordingly remains vested in the legal owner and devolves as if his right to bring the action to recover the land had not been barred by this Act; but, when every right of action to recover the land of any person entitled to a beneficial interest therein has been barred by this Act, that legal estate is extinguished.\n        (3) Where any land is held upon trust (including a trust for sale) and the period prescribed by this Act for the bringing of an action to recover the land by the trustees has expired the estate of the trustees is not extinguished so long as the right of action to recover the land of any person entitled to a beneficial interest therein or in the proceeds of sale either has not accrued or has not been barred by this Act; but when every such right of action has been so barred the estate of the trustees is extinguished.\n        (4) Where any land is held upon trust (including a trust for sale) an action to recover the land may be brought by the trustees on behalf of any person entitled to a beneficial interest in possession in the land or in the proceeds of sale thereof whose right of action has not been barred by this Act, notwithstanding that the right of action of the trustees would, apart from this subsection, have been barred by this Act.\n        (5) Where any settled land or any land held on trust for sale is in possession of a person entitled to a beneficial interest therein or in the proceeds of the sale thereof, not being a person solely and absolutely entitled thereto, no right of action to recover the land shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to accrue during that possession to the legal owner thereof or to any other person entitled to a beneficial interest in the land or in the proceeds of the sale thereof.\n\n14. Forfeiture and breach of condition\n        (1) Subject to subsection (2) , a right of action to recover land by virtue of a forfeiture or breach of condition accrues on the date on which the person in whom the right is vested, or any person through whom he claims, first discovers or may, with reasonable diligence, discover the facts giving the right of forfeiture or showing that the condition is broken.\n        (2) If such a right of action as is referred to in subsection (1) has accrued to a person entitled to an estate or interest in reversion or remainder or any other future estate or interest and the land was not recovered by virtue thereof, the right of action to recover that land shall not be deemed to have accrued to that person until his estate or interest fell into possession, as if the forfeiture or breach of condition had not occurred.\n\n15. Certain tenancies\n        (1) A tenancy at will shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be determined at the expiration of a period of one year from the commencement thereof, unless it has previously been determined, and, accordingly, the right of action of the person entitled to the land subject to the tenancy shall be deemed to have accrued on its determination.\n        (2) Subject to subsection (3) , a tenancy from year to year or other period, without a lease in writing, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be determined at the expiration of the first year or other period; and, accordingly, the right of action of the person entitled to the land subject to the tenancy shall be deemed to have accrued at the date of its determination, except that where rent is subsequently received in respect of the tenancy the right of action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the last receipt of rent.\n        (3) Where a person is in possession of land by virtue of a lease in writing by which a rent amounting to the yearly sum of not less than $100 is reserved, and –\n                (a) the rent is received by some person wrongly claiming to be entitled to the land in reversion immediately expectant on the determination of the lease; and\n                (b) no rent is subsequently received by the person rightfully so entitled –\n        the right of action of the person last-mentioned to recover the land shall be deemed to have accrued at the date when the rent was first received by the person wrongfully claiming to be entitled thereto and not at the date of the determination of the lease.\n        (4) Subsections (1) and (3) do not apply to a tenancy at will or lease granted by the Crown.\n\n16. Right of action not to accrue or continue unless there is adverse possession\n        (1) No right of action to recover land shall be deemed to accrue unless the land is in the possession of some person in whose favour the period of limitation can run (in this section referred to as \"adverse possession\"); and where, under the foregoing provisions of this Act, any such right of action is deemed to accrue on a certain date and no person is in adverse possession on that date the right of action shall not be deemed to accrue unless and until adverse possession is taken of the land.\n        (2) Where a right of action to recover land has accrued and thereafter, before the right is barred, the land ceases to be in adverse possession, the right of action shall no longer be deemed to have accrued and no fresh right of action shall be deemed to accrue until the land is again taken into adverse possession.\n        (3) For the purposes of this section –\n                (a) the possession of land subject to a rentcharge by a person (other than the person entitled to the rentcharge) who does not pay the rent shall be deemed adverse possession of the rentcharge; and\n                (b) receipt of rent under a lease by a person wrongfully claiming, in accordance with section 15(3) , the land in reversion shall be deemed to be adverse possession of the land.\n        (4) Where any one or more of several persons entitled to any land or rent as joint tenants or tenants in common have been in possession or receipt of –\n                (a) the entirety of the land or profits thereof, or the rent, for his or their own benefit or for the benefit of any other person not entitled thereto, or any share therein; or\n                (b) more than his or their undivided share or shares therein, for his or their own benefit or for the benefit of any person not entitled to a share therein –\n        that possession or receipt shall be deemed not to have been the possession or receipt of or by the other persons entitled as joint tenants or tenants in common, but shall be deemed to be adverse possession of the land.\n\n16A. Protection of bona fide purchasers for value without notice\n    Where a right of action has accrued to any person that action cannot be brought by that person or his successors in title against any person who has bona fide purchased a legal estate in land for value without notice of the circumstances which gave rise to the accruer of the right of action.\n\n17.

Limitation on redemption actions\n    When a mortgagee of land has been in possession of any mortgaged land for a period of 12 years, no action to redeem the land of which the mortgagee has been so in possession shall thereafter be brought by the mortgagor or any person claiming through him.\n\n19. Right of action not preserved by formal entry or continual claim\n    For the purposes of this Act no person shall be deemed to have been in possession of any land by reason only of having made formal entry thereon, and no continual or other claim upon or near any land preserves any right of action to recover the land.\n\n20. Administration to date back to death\n    For the purposes of the provisions of this Act relating to actions for the recovery of land an administrator of the estate of a deceased person shall be deemed to claim as if there had been no interval of time between the death of the deceased person and the grant of letters of administration.\n\n21.

Effect of acknowledgement or part payment on persons other than the maker or recipient\n        (1) An acknowledgement of the title to any land or mortgaged personalty by any person in possession thereof shall bind all other persons in possession during the ensuing period of limitation.\n        (2) A payment in respect of a mortgage debt by the mortgagor or any person in possession of the mortgaged property shall, so far as any right of the mortgagee to foreclose or otherwise to recover the property is concerned, bind all other persons in possession of the mortgaged property during the ensuing period of limitation.\n        (3) Where 2 or more mortgagees are by virtue of the mortgage in possession of the mortgaged land, an acknowledgement of the mortgagor's title or of his equity of redemption or right to discharge of the mortgage by one of the mortgagees shall only bind him and his successors and shall not bind any other mortgagee or his successors; and where the mortgagee by whom the acknowledgement is given is entitled to a part of the mortgaged land and not to any ascertained part of the mortgage debt, the mortgagor shall be entitled to redeem or to compel discharge of the mortgage of that part of the land on payment, with interest, of the part of the mortgage debt which bears the same proportion to the whole of the debt as the value of the part of the land bears to the whole of the mortgaged land.\n        (4) Where there are 2 or more mortgagors and the title or right to redemption or to the discharge of the mortgage of one of the mortgagors is acknowledged as aforesaid the acknowledgement shall be deemed to have been made to all mortgagors.\n        (5) Subject to subsection (6) an acknowledgement of any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim shall bind the acknowledgor and his successors but not any other person.\n        (6) An acknowledgement made after the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed for the bringing of an action to recover a debt or other claim shall not bind any successor on whom the liability devolves on the determination of a preceding estate or interest in property under a settlement taking effect before the date of the acknowledgement.\n        (7) Subject to subsection (8) , a payment made in respect of any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim shall bind all persons liable in respect thereof.\n        (8) A payment made after the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed for the bringing of an action to recover the debt or other claim shall not bind –\n                (a) any person other than the person making the payment and his successors; or\n                (b) any successor on whom the liability devolved on the determination of a preceding estate or interest in property under a settlement taking effect before the date of the payment.\n        (9) An acknowledgement by one of several personal representatives of any claim to the personal estate of a deceased person or to any share or interest therein, or a payment by one of several personal representatives in respect of any such claim, shall bind the estate of the deceased person.\n        (10) In this section the expression successor in relation to any mortgagee or person liable in respect of any debt or claim means his personal representatives and any other person on whom the rights under the mortgage or, as the case may be, the liability in respect of the debt or claim devolve, whether on death or bankruptcy or the disposition of property or the determination of a limited estate or interest in settled property or otherwise.\n\nDivision 3 - Fraud and mistake\n\n32.

Interpretation\n    In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears –\n        court includes arbitrator;\n        limitation law means a law that provides for the limitation or exclusion of any liability in respect of a cause of action or the barring of a right of action by reference to the time when a proceeding on, or the arbitration of, the cause of action is commenced.\n\n32B.

Characterization of limitation laws\n    If the substantive law of another place, being another State, a Territory or New Zealand, is to govern a cause of action before a court of this State, a limitation law of that place is to be regarded as part of that substantive law and applied accordingly by the court.\n\n32D. Exercise of discretion under limitation law\n    Where a court of this State exercises a discretion conferred under a limitation law of a place, being another State, a Territory or New Zealand, that discretion, as far as practicable, is to be exercised in a manner in which it is exercised in comparable cases by the courts of that place.\n\nPART IV - Miscellaneous and Supplemental\n\n33.

Act to apply to foreclosure under Land Titles Act 1980\n    This Act applies to applications for foreclosure under the Land Titles Act 1980 in like manner as it applies to foreclosure actions.\n\n35.

Acquiescence\n    Nothing in this Act shall affect any equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the ground of acquiescence or otherwise.\n\n37.

Actions already barred and pending actions\n        (1) Nothing in this Act enables any action to be brought that was barred before the commencement of this Act, except in so far as the cause of action or right of action may be revived by an acknowledgement or part payment made in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n        (2) Nothing in this Act affects any action or arbitration commenced before the commencement of this Act or the title to any property that is the subject of any such action or arbitration.\n\n40.
