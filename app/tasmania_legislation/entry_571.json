\n\n  Historic Cultural Heritage Act 1995      IMPORTANT: If the specified land, or part of it, is listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register, any works or developments on the land must have heritage approval under the Historic Cultural Heritage Act 1995.      Enquiries should be directed to Heritage Tasmania.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n  Mineral Resources Development Act 1995    No.  Question  Answer  20.  Notification of landslip status      (a) Has the council a record of having been notified by a State Agency that –      (i) the specified land is within a declared landslip area; or      (ii) an order is to be made, under Part 9A of the Act, that will apply to the specified land?      (b) If YES to (a)(i), what type of landslip area has been declared to apply to the specified land? Provide particulars.      (c) If YES to (a)(ii), what is the nature of the order to be made under Part 9A of the Act, applicable to the specified land? Provide particulars.      IMPORTANT: If \"No\" to question 20(a), it should be noted that there are only a small number of declared landslip areas in Tasmania. Although the specified land is not within a declared landslip area it may be prudent for the purchaser to consider whether the slope stability of the land will support the proposed use. If the specified land is on or adjacent to a slope, slope stability could be a hazard and it may be necessary to have site-specific geotechnical investigations carried out.      The council may also require information on geotechnical and other relevant factors about the specified land before it will consider a building or planning application relating to that land. Restrictions may also apply to building and development in relation to the specified land.      Further enquiries should be directed to the council.      NOTE:An officer responding to this question is also required to consider, in accordance with question 49, whether the specified land is within, or includes, an area that is a landslip hazard area.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n\nPART 4 - Highway Construction, Maintenance and Access Matters\n\n  Roads and Jetties Act 1935    No.  Question  Answer    IMPORTANT: The specified land may be affected by statutory limitations on access, the proclamation of an intended line of a state highway(s) or subsidiary road(s) and other State road planning matters.
