Interpretation\n        (1) In this Act –\n            adopted child –\n                    (a) in the case of a child that is adopted in this State, means a child that is adopted by a person, or by a person and his spouse jointly, in accordance with the law relating to the adoption of children; or\n                    (b) in the case of a child that is adopted elsewhere than in this State, means a child that is adopted by a person, or by a person and his spouse jointly, in accordance with the law of the State, Territory, or country where the adoption takes place, as in force at the date of the adoption;\n            child includes –\n                    (a) an adopted child; and\n                    (b) a stepchild; and\n                    (c) a surrogate child;\n            Court means the Supreme Court;\n            spouse includes the person with whom a person is, or was at the time of his or her death, in a significant relationship, within the meaning of the Relationships Act 2003 ;\n            stepchild means, in relation to a person –\n                    (a) a child of that person's spouse; and\n                    (b) a child whose natural parent was the spouse of that person at the time of the natural parent's death;\n            surrogate child means, in relation to another person, a person (whether or not the person has attained the age of 18 years) –\n                    (a) who is a child of the other person by virtue of the operation of section 26(1) of the Surrogacy Act 2012 , or a law, of another State or a Territory or a foreign country, that corresponds to that Act; and\n                    (b) who has not ceased to be a child of the other person under that Act or law;\n            will includes a codicil and a nomination made in accordance with the rules of a society within the meaning of the Friendly Societies (Tasmania) Code.\n        (2) For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of stepchild, as substituted by the Justice and Related Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2015, does not apply in respect of a claim against the estate of a person whose death occurred before the commencement of that Act.\n        (3) . . . . . . . .\n        (4) . . . . . . . .\n        (5) . . . . . . . .\n\n3.

Adjustment of estate duty\n    For the purpose of apportioning the duty payable on the estate of a deceased person, any provision directed to be made by an order under this Act shall –\n            (a) if the deceased person died testate, be deemed to be a bequest made by the deceased person by a codicil executed immediately before his death; or\n            (b) if the deceased person died intestate, be deemed to be a bequest made by the deceased person as if effected by a will made by him immediately before his death.\n\n11. Time within which application to be made\n        (1) Except as provided by subsection (2) of this section, the Court or judge shall have no jurisdiction to hear any application, or to make any order under this Act, unless the summons hereinbefore mentioned be taken out before or not later than three months after the date of grant of probate of the will of the deceased person, or letters of administration of the estate of the deceased person, as the case may be.\n        (2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, upon application being made in that behalf by a person claiming the benefit of this Act, the Court or a judge may, after hearing such of the persons affected or likely to be affected by that application as it or he may think fit, extend the time limited by that subsection for the taking out of a summons for such further period as the Court or judge may think necessary.\n        (3) The powers conferred on the Court or a judge by subsection (2) of this section may be exercised notwithstanding that the time limited by subsection (1) of this section for the taking out of a summons may have expired (whether that time expired or expires before or after the commencement of this subsection).\n        (4) An application under subsection (2) of this section shall be made before the final distribution of the estate of the deceased person, and no distribution of any part of the estate made before the making of an application under that subsection shall be disturbed by reason of that application or of any order made thereon or in consequence thereof."
