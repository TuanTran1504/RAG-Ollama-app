Rating and charging policies to be made available to public\n        (1) A council must adopt a rates and charges policy by 31 August 2012.\n        (2) A council's rates and charges policy must contain –\n                (a) a statement of the policy that the council intends to apply in exercising its powers, or performing its functions, under this Part; and\n                (b) a statement of policy in respect of prescribed matters, if any.\n        (3) A council's rates and charges policy in relation to the making or varying of a rate must take into account the principles referred to in section 86A(1) .\n        (4) A council must review its rates and charges policy –\n                (a) by the end of each successive 4-year period after 31 August 2012; and\n                (b) at the same time as, or before, making a type of rate, charge or averaged area rate in respect of a financial year, if a rate, charge or averaged area rate of that type was not made in respect of the previous financial year; and\n                (c) at the same time as, or before, making under section 107 a variation of a rate or charge in respect of a financial year, if such a variation of that rate or charge was not made in respect of the previous financial year; and\n                (d) at the same time as, or before, setting a minimum amount under this Part; and\n                (e) at the same time as, or before, altering the circumstances in which a rate, charge or averaged area rate, or a variation of a rate or charge, is to apply to rateable land.\n        (5) A council, as soon as reasonably practicable after adopting or altering its rates and charges policy, must make copies of the policy as so adopted or altered available to the public –\n                (a) in paper form, on payment of a reasonable charge; and\n                (b) in electronic form, at a website of the council, free of charge.\n        (6) A rate, averaged area rate or charge is not invalid by reason only that it does not conform to the council's rates and charges policy.\n\n87.

Rates collected on behalf of authorities\n        (1) A statutory authority which has power to make rates based on the valuation list under the Valuation of Land Act 2001 may enter into an agreement with a council for the council to collect the rates on its behalf.\n        (2) An agreement may contain a provision that the statutory authority is to pay the council a commission for the collection of the rates.\n        (3) If a council agrees to collect rates on behalf of a statutory authority, the council may –\n                (a) incorporate the rates with its own rates; and\n                (b) recover the rates under Division 10 as if they were a debt due to the council.\n\n88A.

Refund of separate rate or charge\n        (1) A council is to refund any revenue raised by the payment of a separate rate or separate charge to affected ratepayers if–\n                (a) the council resolves not to carry into effect the purpose for which the separate rate or separate charge was imposed; or\n                (b) there is an excess of funds over the amount required for that purpose.\n        (2) Any refund is to be paid to the affected ratepayers proportionally according to the amounts paid by each of them.\n        (3) Instead of refunding an amount to a ratepayer, a council may credit that amount against any other rate or charge payable by the ratepayer.\n\n106A. Exemptions and variations\n        (1) A council, by absolute majority, may –\n                (a) exempt land or a class of land from a separate rate or separate charge; or\n                (b) vary the amount of a separate rate or separate charge payable in respect of land or a class of land, having regard to –\n                        (i) the use or predominant use of the land or class of land; or\n                        (ii) the non-use of the land; or\n                        (iii) the locality of the land or class of land; or\n                        (iv) any other prescribed factor.\n        (2) In this section,\n            use has the same meaning as in section 107 .\n\nDivision 6 - Variation in rates\n\n107. Variation in rates\n        (1) A council, by absolute majority, may declare that the general rate, a service rate or a service charge varies within the municipal area or within different parts of the municipal area according to any or all, or a combination of any or all, of the following factors:\n                (a) the use or predominant use of the land;\n                (b) the non-use of the land;\n                (c) the locality of the land;\n                (d) any planning zone;\n                (e) any other prescribed factor.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (a) , use means use for any of the following purposes:\n                (a) residential purposes;\n                (ab) commercial purposes;\n                (ac) industrial purposes;\n                (b) public purposes;\n                (c) primary production;\n                (d) sporting or recreation facilities;\n                (e) quarrying or mining.\n        (2A) If a general rate is varied under subsection (1) according to a factor, the council may, if the general rate does not include a fixed charge, set a minimum amount payable in respect of that rate as varied in accordance with that factor.\n        (2B) A council may not set under subsection (2A) a minimum amount payable in respect of a general rate varied under subsection (1) in accordance with a factor if the minimum amount would –\n                (a) in respect of the 2012-2013 financial year, apply to more than the relevant percentage in respect of the council, as determined under section 89B for that financial year, of the number of areas of land that is rateable land to which that factor relates; or\n                (b) in respect of any other financial year, apply to more than the relevant percentage in respect of the council, as determined under section 89B for that financial year, of the number of areas of land that is rateable land to which that factor relates.\n        (2C) If a minimum amount payable in respect of a general rate is set under subsection (2A) and that minimum amount applies in relation to rateable land, a minimum amount, if any, set under section 90(4) in respect of the general rate does not apply in relation to the rateable land.\n        (3) A council must not apply a higher general rate on a State Government body than it would apply on a body of a similar nature that is not a State Government body.\n        (4) In this section –\n            Government Business Enterprise has the same meaning as in the Government Business Enterprises Act 1995 ;\n            State Government body means a State Service Agency, a statutory authority, a State-owned company or a Government Business Enterprise;\n            State-owned company means a company incorporated under the Corporations Act that is controlled by the Crown, a Government Business Enterprise or a statutory authority or another company that is so controlled;\n            statutory authority means a body or authority, whether incorporated or not, that is established or constituted by or under an Act or under the Royal Prerogative, being a body or authority which, or of which the governing authority, wholly or partly comprises a person or persons appointed by the Governor, a Minister or another statutory authority but does not include a State Service Agency.\n\n108.

Objections to variations\n        (1) A ratepayer may object to a variation in a rate based on a particular use of land.\n        (2) The only ground for an objection is that the use of the ratepayer's land is not the use of land on which the variation is based.\n        (3) An objection is to –\n                (a) be made in writing within 21 days after receipt of a notice under section 108 notifying the variation; and\n                (b) state the use of the ratepayer's land; and\n                (c) be accompanied by evidence of the use of the land; and\n                (d) be lodged with the general manager.\n        (4) A council is to make a decision in respect of an objection within 60 days after the objection is lodged.\n        (5) The council may decide that the variation in the rate –\n                (a) applies to the ratepayer based on the use of the ratepayer's land; or\n                (b) does not apply because of the use of the ratepayer's land.\n        (6) A ratepayer may apply to the Magistrates Court (Administrative Appeals Division) for a review of –\n                (a) a council's decision under subsection (5) ; or\n                (b) a council's failure to make a decision under subsection (5) ; or\n                (c) a council's failure to make a decision within the period specified in subsection (4) .\n        (7) If the council does not make a decision in respect of an objection within 60 days after the objection is lodged, the council is taken to have made a decision in respect of that objection on the last day of that period.\n\nDivision 6A - Averaged area rates\n\n109A. Averaged area rates may be made for locality\n        (1) A council, on the same day as the day on which it makes a general rate in respect of a financial year, may make, in respect of the financial year, an averaged area rate.\n        (2) An averaged area rate is to apply to a category of rateable land in a locality within the municipal area of the council.\n        (3) A council may only make under subsection (1) in respect of a financial year an averaged area rate that applies to a category of rateable land in a locality if authorised by a certificate to do so.\n        (4) A council may make under subsection (1) an averaged area rate that applies to a category of rateable land in a locality whether or not the council provides any services in respect of land in the locality.\n        (5) The categories of rateable land are the following:\n                (a) rateable land that is used, or predominantly used, for residential purposes;\n                (b) rateable land that is –\n                        (i) used, or predominantly used, for residential purposes; and\n                        (ii) of a value that is within a range of values of land;\n                (c) rateable land that may be classified as both –\n                        (i) being used, or predominantly used, for residential purposes; and\n                        (ii) non-use land.\n        (6) The general rate in respect of a financial year is not payable in relation to rateable land, in a locality, in relation to which an averaged area rate is payable in respect of that financial year.\n\n109B. Determination of amount of averaged area rate\n        (1) In this section –\n            applicable area of land, in relation to an averaged area rate, means an area of land that is rateable land in a locality and that is within the category of rateable land, in the locality, to which the rate applies.\n        (2) The amount of an averaged area rate must be expressed in dollars or in dollars and cents.\n        (3) The amount of an averaged area rate must be the amount obtained by dividing, by the number of applicable areas of land, the sum of all the relevant amounts in relation to the applicable areas of land.\n        (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) , the relevant amount in relation to an applicable area of land is the amount of the general rate that would be payable in respect of the land if the general rate applied in respect of the land for the financial year for which the averaged area rate is to apply.\n        (5) For the purposes of subsection (4) , the calculation, in relation to an applicable area of land, of the general rate payable in relation to land for the financial year in respect of which the averaged area rate is to apply must be made on the basis of the valuation that had effect in relation to the land immediately before that averaged area rate is made.\n        (6) For the purposes of subsection (5) , a supplementary valuation, of an area of land, that is made after the averaged area rate is made is not to be taken under section 89A to have effect in relation to the land immediately before that averaged area rate is made.\n        (7) The same category of value of land as the general rate is based on under section 90(3) in respect of a financial year must be used in determining –\n                (a) the relevant amount for the financial year in respect of an applicable area of land; and\n                (b) whether the value of an applicable area of land is within a range of values of land.\n\n109C.

Interpretation\n            (1) In this Schedule –\n                absolute majority of votes, in relation to a candidate, is a number of votes which is greater than one-half of the total number of ballot papers, other than exhausted and informal ballot papers, on which electors have recorded their votes for the candidate;\n                informal ballot paper means a ballot paper which is informal as specified in section 300 ;\n                quota means the number of votes sufficient to elect a candidate;\n                second preference recorded for a candidate means the preference on a ballot paper recorded by the number \"2\" in the square opposite the name of the candidate on the ballot paper;\n                surplus means the number of votes which a candidate obtained at any stage of the counting of votes in excess of the quota;\n                transfer value means that portion of a vote which is unused by –\n                        (a) an elected candidate who has obtained a surplus; or\n                        (b) a candidate excluded on account of being lowest on the poll and which is transferred to the candidate next in the order of the elector's preference.\n            (2) For the purpose of the definition of \"transfer value\", the transfer value is either one or a fraction of one.\n\nPART 2 - Mayoral or Councillor Elections\n\n    2. First preferences\n            (1) The number of first preferences recorded for each candidate is to be counted and all informal ballot papers are to be rejected.\n            (2) The candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes is to be elected.\n    3. Second and subsequent preferences\n            (1) If no candidate has an absolute majority of votes, the candidate who has the fewest votes is to be excluded and each ballot paper counted to that candidate, unless exhausted, is to be counted to the unexcluded candidate next in the order of the elector's preference.\n            (2) The process specified in subclause (1) is to be repeated until one candidate has an absolute majority of votes.\n    4. Ballot paper counted and exhausted\n            (1) Every ballot paper, not rejected as informal, is to be counted in every count until it becomes exhausted, when it is to be rejected in all further counts.\n            (2) If a candidate is excluded, any ballot paper counted to the candidate is exhausted if there is not indicated on it a consecutive preference for one or more unexcluded candidates.\n    5. Returning officer to decide exclusion and election\n            (1) If, on any count, 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them has to be excluded, the returning officer is to decide which candidate is to be excluded by the drawing or casting of lots in the prescribed manner.\n            (2) If in the final count, 2 candidates have an equal number of votes, the returning officer is to decide which of them is to be elected by the drawing or casting of lots in the prescribed manner.\n\nPART 3 - Councillor Elections\n\n    6. Quota\n            (1) The quota is calculated in accordance with the following formula:\n            where –\n                Q is the quota;\n                FP is the total number of first preferences;\n                C is the total number of candidates to be elected.\n            (2) Any remainder in calculating the quota is to be disregarded.\n            (3) Subject to clause 13 (6) , a candidate is not to be elected until the candidate obtains a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota.\n    7.

First preferences in excess of quota\n        If the number of first preferences obtained by a candidate exceeds the quota, the proportion of those preferences in excess of the quota is to be transferred to the other candidates not yet elected next in the order of the electors' respective preferences in the following manner:\n                (a) all the ballot papers on which a first preference is recorded for the elected candidate are to be re-examined and the number of second preferences, or in the case provided for in clause 10 , third or next consecutive preferences, recorded for each unelected candidate are to be counted.\n                (b) the surplus of the elected candidate is to be divided by the total number of votes obtained by the candidate on the counting of the first preferences and the resulting fraction is the transfer value;\n                (c) the number of second or other preferences recorded for each unelected candidate is to be multiplied by the transfer value;\n                (d) the resulting number of votes, truncated to 2 decimal places, is to be transferred to each unelected candidate and added to the number of votes obtained by the candidate on the counting of the first preferences.\n    10. Surplus\n            (1) If, on the counting of the first preferences or on a transfer, more than one candidate has a surplus, the largest surplus is to be dealt with first.\n            (2) If at that stage more than one candidate has a surplus, the then largest surplus is to be dealt with next, and so on.\n            (3) If one candidate has obtained a surplus at a count or transfer previous to that at which another candidate obtains a surplus, the surplus of the former is to be dealt with first.\n            (4) If 2 or more surpluses are equal, the surplus of the candidate who was the highest at the count or transfer at which they last had an unequal number of votes is to be dealt with first.\n            (5) If the 2 or more candidates had an equal number of votes at all preceding counts or transfers, the returning officer is to decide which candidate's surplus is to be dealt with first.\n    11. Quota by transfer\n            (1) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased to a number which is equal to, or exceeds, the quota by a transfer, the candidate is to be elected.\n            (2) Notwithstanding the fact that the candidate has reached the quota, the transfer is to be completed and all the votes to which the candidate is entitled from the transfer are to be transferred to the candidates, but no votes of any other candidate are to be transferred to the candidate.\n            (3) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased by a transfer to a number which is equal to the quota, all of the ballot papers on which the votes are recorded are to be set aside as finally dealt with.\n            (4) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased by a transfer to a number which exceeds the quota, the surplus is to be transferred to the candidates next in the order of the voters' respective preferences, in the following manner:\n                    (a) the ballot papers on which are recorded the votes obtained by the elected candidate in the last transfer are to be re-examined and the number of third preferences, or in the case provided for in clause 10 , next consecutive preferences, recorded for each unelected candidate counted;\n                    (b) the surplus of the elected candidate is to be divided by the total number of ballot papers mentioned in paragraph (a) and the resulting fraction is the transfer value;\n                    (c) the number of third or other preferences recorded for each unelected candidate is to be multiplied by the transfer value;\n                    (d) the resulting number, truncated to 2 decimal places, is to be credited to each unelected candidate and added to the number of votes previously obtained by the candidate.\n    12. Transfer of votes\n            (1) If, after the first preferences have been counted and any surplus has been transferred, no candidate, or less than the number of candidates required to be elected, has obtained the quota –\n                    (a) the candidate who at that time, has the least number of first preference votes transferred is to be excluded; and\n                    (b) all the votes obtained by that candidate are to be transferred to the candidates next in the order of the electors' respective preferences in the same manner as provided by clause 4 .\n            (2) The votes received by the excluded candidate are to be sorted into groups according to their transfer values when received by that candidate.\n            (3) The groups are to be transferred at the transfer value at which they were received in the following order:\n                    (a) firstly, the group with the highest transfer value;\n                    (b) secondly, the remaining groups in descending order of transfer value.\n            (4) Each transfer under subclause (3) is a separate transfer.\n    13. Votes increased by transfer\n            (1) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate by a transfer is increased to a number which is equal to, or exceeds, the quota the candidate is to be elected.\n            (2) Notwithstanding that the candidate has reached the quota, the transfer is to be completed and all the votes to which the candidate is entitled from the transfer are to be transferred to the candidate, but no other votes are to be transferred.\n            (3) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased by a transfer to a number of votes which is equal to, but does not exceed, the quota, all the ballot papers on which those votes are recorded are to be set aside as finally dealt with.\n            (4) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased by a transfer to a number which exceeds the quota, the surplus is to be transferred to the candidates next in the order of the electors' respective preferences in the same manner as provided by clause 11 (4) , but that surplus is not to be dealt with until all the votes of the excluded candidate have been transferred.\n            (5) If there is a surplus, it is to be dealt with before any other candidate is excluded.\n            (6) The process of excluding the candidate who has polled the next lowest number of votes and transferring the vote to other candidates is to be repeated until all the candidates, except the number required to be elected, have been excluded and the unexcluded candidates who have not already been elected are then elected.\n    14. Order of preference\n        In determining which candidate is next in the order of an elector's preference –\n                (a) any candidate who has been elected or excluded is not to be considered; and\n                (b) the order of the elector's preference is to be determined as if the names of those candidates had not been on the ballot paper.\n    15. Exclusion of candidates\n            (1) If it is necessary to exclude a candidate, and 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes, having at that time the least number of first preference votes transferred to them, whichever of those candidates was the lowest on the poll at the last count or transfer at which they had an unequal number of votes is excluded first.\n            (2) If the candidates had an equal number of votes at all preceding counts or transfers, the returning officer is to decide which candidate is to be excluded first by the drawing or casting of lots in the prescribed manner.\n    16. Exhausted ballot paper\n        If, on a transfer, it is found that on a ballot paper there is no candidate opposite whose name a number is placed, other than a candidate whose name has already been elected or excluded, the ballot paper is to be set aside as exhausted.\n    17. Order of election\n            (1) The order of election of councillors is the order in which the candidates receive a quota.\n            (2) If more than one candidate receives a quota at the same count or transfer, the candidate with the highest number of votes is elected first, the candidate with the next highest number of votes is elected second and so on.\n            (3) If under clause 13(6) one candidate is elected without a quota, that candidate is elected last.\n            (4) If under clause 13(6) more than one candidate is elected without a quota and it is necessary to determine the order of election of those candidates for any reason, the votes received by the remaining unelected candidates are to be distributed until only one candidate has received less than a quota.\n\nSCHEDULE 8 - Recount to Fill a Casual Vacancy\n\nSection 307\n\nPART 1 - General\n\n    1.
