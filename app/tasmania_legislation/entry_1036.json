Assessment criteria\n    The assessment criteria are –\n            (a) the person has, or appears to have, a mental illness that requires or is likely to require treatment for –\n                    (i) the person's health or safety; or\n                    (ii) the safety of other persons; and\n            (b) the person cannot be properly assessed with regard to the mental illness or the making of a treatment order except under the authority of the assessment order; and\n            (c) the person does not have decision-making capacity.\n\n26. Form and content of assessment order\n        (1) To be valid, an assessment order must –\n                (a) be in an approved form; and\n                (b) be correctly completed.\n        (2) An assessment order is taken to be correctly completed if it –\n                (a) . . . . . . . .\n                (b) identifies the patient; and\n                (c) specifies when the examination referred to in section 24(1)(c) was done; and\n                (d) affirms that the patient needs to be assessed against the assessment criteria; and\n                (e) specifies an assessment setting; and\n                (ea) specifies if the order authorises the patient's admission to and detention in an approved hospital; and\n                (f) specifies (by date and time) when it was made; and\n                (g) specifies or provides for any matter required by the regulations; and\n                (h) identifies, and is signed by, the medical practitioner who makes it.\n        (3) . . . . . . . .\n        (4) An assessment order may, without compromising its validity, specify or provide for any matters, incidental to the assessment of the person in respect of whom the order is made, that the medical practitioner making it considers necessary or desirable in the circumstances.\n\n27. Effect of assessment order\n        (1) An assessment order is authority for the patient to be assessed, without informed consent, by an approved medical practitioner, to –\n                (a) confirm whether the patient meets the assessment criteria; and\n                (b) determine if the patient also meets the treatment criteria.\n        (2) An assessment order is authority –\n                (a) for any MHO or police officer to take the patient under escort to ensure that he or she presents for assessment under the order; and\n                (b) if authorised to do so –\n                        (i) by the terms of the order; or\n                        (ii) by a medical practitioner under subsection (4) –\n                for the patient to be admitted to an approved facility and, if necessary, detained in an approved facility for and in connection with that assessment.\n        (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) –\n                (a) the medical practitioner who makes the assessment order or any other medical practitioner may request that the patient be taken under escort (in which case the medical practitioner is to ensure that the escort is given a copy of the order); and\n                (b) the custody and escort provisions apply, and continue to apply for so long as the patient is subject to the assessment order.\n        (4) Despite subsection (2)(b)(ii) , a medical practitioner is not to authorise a patient who is a child to be admitted to and, if necessary, detained in an approved hospital unless the medical practitioner is satisfied that the hospital –\n                (a) has facilities and staff for the assessment of the patient; and\n                (b) is, in the circumstances, the most appropriate place available to accommodate the patient.\n        (5) An assessment order is not authority for a patient to be given any treatment.\n\n28. When does assessment order take effect?\n    An assessment order takes effect as soon as it is signed by the medical practitioner who makes it.\n\n            Note\n        The making of an assessment order is reviewable by the Tribunal – see Division 2 of Part 3 of Chapter 3 .\n\n29. Action to be taken by medical practitioner on making assessment order\n    A medical practitioner who makes an assessment order is to –\n            (a) give a copy of the order to the patient (together with a statement of rights in an approved form); and\n            (b) give a copy of the order to the approved medical practitioner who is likely to do the assessment or, if applicable, the controlling authority of the approved facility where the patient is to be, or is likely to be, assessed; and\n            (c) place a copy of the order on the patient's clinical record (ensuring that such a clinical record is created if one does not already exist).\n\n30. Assessment of patient\n        (1) Once an assessment order has taken effect, the patient must be independently assessed within 24 hours unless the order is sooner discharged.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) , an assessment is independent if and only if it is done by an approved medical practitioner other than the medical practitioner who applied for or made the assessment order.\n\n                Note\n            A failure to observe subsection (1) extinguishes the order – see section 34 .\n\n31.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n32. Affirmation or discharge of assessment order\n        (1) This section applies once a patient who is subject to an assessment order has been independently assessed by an approved medical practitioner.\n        (2) The approved medical practitioner must immediately affirm or discharge the assessment order.\n        (3) To affirm the assessment order, the approved medical practitioner must be satisfied that –\n                (a) the patient meets the assessment criteria; and\n                (b) the order has not already been discharged.\n        (4) If the approved medical practitioner affirms the assessment order, he or she may simultaneously extend its operation, once, by a period not exceeding 72 hours commencing from the time of affirmation.\n        (5) The affirmation is to be effected by means of a signed instrument in writing in an approved form, and is invalid if not in that form.\n        (6) The instrument of affirmation takes effect as soon as it is signed.\n        (7) If the approved medical practitioner affirms the assessment order, the procedure in section 33 is to be followed.\n        (8) If the approved medical practitioner discharges the assessment order, the procedure in section 35(3) and (4) is to be followed.\n\n33. Action to be taken by medical practitioner on affirming assessment order\n        (1) An approved medical practitioner who affirms an assessment order is to –\n                (a) give notice to that effect to –\n                        (i) the patient; and\n                        (ii) the medical practitioner who made the order; and\n                        (iii) the Chief Psychiatrist; and\n                        (iv) the Tribunal; and\n                        (v) if the patient is to be, or is likely to be, assessed in an approved facility, the controlling authority of the facility; and\n                (b) place a copy of the instrument of affirmation on the patient's clinical record (ensuring that such a clinical record is created if one does not already exist).\n        (2) The notice under subsection (1)(a) is to advise of any extension of the operation of the assessment order.\n\n34. Duration of assessment order\n    An assessment order ceases to have effect –\n            (a) 24 hours after it takes effect if, by then –\n                    (i) it has not been affirmed under section 32 ; or\n                    (ii) it has been affirmed under section 32 but not extended in operation under that section; or\n            (b) if it is affirmed under section 32 and extended in operation under that section, at the end of the period of extension; or\n            (c) if it is sooner discharged under section 35 ; or\n            (d) if a treatment order is made in respect of the person who is subject to the assessment order.\n\n35. Discharge of assessment order by medical practitioner or Tribunal\n        (1) An assessment order may be discharged at any time for sufficient cause by –\n                (a) the medical practitioner who made it; or\n                (b) any approved medical practitioner; or\n                (c) the Tribunal under section 180 .\n        (2) A medical practitioner has sufficient cause to discharge an assessment order if he or she is satisfied, after assessing the patient or on other reasonable grounds, that the patient does not meet the assessment criteria.\n        (3) In the case of a medical practitioner, the discharge is to be effected by means of a signed instrument in writing in an approved form (the discharge paper).\n        (4) A medical practitioner who discharges an assessment order is to –\n                (a) give a copy of the discharge paper to –\n                        (i) the patient; and\n                        (ii) the Chief Psychiatrist; and\n                        (iii) the Tribunal; and\n                        (iv) if the relevant independent assessment has not been done, the approved medical practitioner who was expected to do the assessment or, if applicable, the controlling authority of the approved facility where the assessment was to have been done; and\n                (b) place a copy of the discharge paper on the patient's clinical record.\n\n                Note\n            For a Tribunal discharge – see Division 2 of Part 3 of Chapter 3 .\n\nDivision 2 - Treatment orders\n\n36. Who can make a treatment order?\n    Treatment orders are made by the Tribunal.\n\n            Note\n        Interim treatment orders, however, may be made by a single member of the Tribunal – see section 38 .\n\n37. Application for treatment order\n        (1) Any approved medical practitioner may apply to the Tribunal for a treatment order in respect of a person.\n        (2) The application may be made whether or not the person is subject to an assessment order.\n        (3) If the person is subject to an assessment order, the application should only be made if –\n                (a) the applicant has assessed the person under the authority of the assessment order; and\n                (b) the applicant is satisfied from the assessment that the person meets the treatment criteria.\n\n                Note\n            The treatment criteria are set out in section 40 .\n        (4) If the person is not subject to an assessment order, the application should only be made if –\n                (a) the person has been assessed by the applicant and one other approved medical practitioner, separately, within the preceding 7 days; and\n                (b) the applicant and the other approved medical practitioner are both satisfied from their respective assessments that the person meets the treatment criteria.\n        (5) The application in relation to a person is to be in accordance with section 195 and be accompanied by –\n                (a) a statement by the applicant affirming that (and explaining how) the person meets the treatment criteria; and\n                (b) . . . . . . . .\n                (c) an indication as to whether an interim treatment order is needed; and\n                (d) if the person is subject to an assessment order, a copy of that order.\n        (6) The applicant is to –\n                (a) give a copy of the application to the person (together with a statement of rights in a form approved by the President of the Tribunal); and\n                (b) place a copy of the application (and accompanying documentation) on the person's clinical record (ensuring that such a clinical record is created if one does not already exist).\n\n38. Interim treatment order\n        (1) Despite section 36 , a single member of the Tribunal may make an interim treatment order in respect of a person if, but only if, the member is satisfied that –\n                (a) an approved medical practitioner has applied for a treatment order in respect of the person; and\n                (b) the requirements of section 37 appear to have been met in respect of the application; and\n                (c) the person meets the treatment criteria; and\n                (d) the Tribunal cannot immediately determine the application; and\n                (e) the delay that would be involved in awaiting a decision of the Tribunal under section 39 should the interim treatment order not be made would, or is likely to, seriously harm –\n                        (i) the person's health or safety; or\n                        (ii) the safety of other persons.\n        (2) An interim treatment order may include a requirement –\n                (a) that the treatment setting for a patient be –\n                        (i) an approved facility (other than an SMHU), or a premises or place, specified in the order; or\n                        (ii) a type of approved facility (other than an SMHU), or a type of premises or place, specified in the order; and\n                (b) that, for the purposes of receiving treatment, a patient may be admitted to and, if necessary, detained in –\n                        (i) an approved facility (other than an SMHU) specified in the order; or\n                        (ii) a type of approved facility (other than an SMHU) specified in the order.\n        (2A) An interim treatment order may provide for a combination of treatment settings and for the admission and re-admission of the patient to those settings.\n        (3) Despite subsection (2) , the Tribunal member is not to make an interim treatment order requiring a patient who is a child to be admitted to and, if necessary, detained in an approved hospital for the purposes of receiving treatment unless the member is satisfied that the hospital –\n                (a) has facilities and staff for the treatment and care of the patient; and\n                (b) is, in the circumstances, the most appropriate place available to accommodate the patient.\n        (4) The Tribunal member may make the interim treatment order on the basis of the application alone, without any hearing or further investigation.\n        (5) Section 41 applies in relation to the making of an interim treatment order.\n        (6) If an interim treatment order is made, the order is, for all purposes, taken to be a treatment order made by the Tribunal except that sections 43 , 44 and 48 do not apply in relation to the order.\n        (7) The interim treatment order –\n                (a) takes effect as soon as it is made; and\n                (b) continues in effect, subject to subsection (8) , until the application is determined by the Tribunal.\n        (8) Any Tribunal member may revoke or amend the interim treatment order at any time.\n        (9) The interim treatment order lapses after 10 days (calculated from the precise time it is made) if, by then, the Tribunal has not determined the application.\n\n39.

Discharge of Tribunal treatment authorisation\n    The Tribunal may discharge an authorisation under section 88 at any time while the patient is a forensic patient.\n\n90. Authorisation becomes treatment order when person ceases to be forensic patient\n    If a patient to whom an authorisation under section 88 applies ceases to be a forensic patient on a day, the authorisation is taken to be a treatment order in relation to the person on and from that day for a period of 6 months, unless the treatment order is discharged or otherwise ceases to be in effect.\n\n91. Interim authorisation of treatment by Tribunal member\n        (1) A single member of the Tribunal (the Tribunal member) may authorise treatment for a forensic patient if satisfied that –\n                (a) the treatment has been recommended and applied for by an approved medical practitioner (the applicant) in accordance with section 195 ; and\n                (b) the Tribunal cannot immediately determine the application; and\n                (c) the criteria specified in section 88(1)(b) , (c) , (d) and (e) are satisfied; and\n                (d) achieving the treatment outcomes would be compromised by waiting for the treatment to be authorised by the Tribunal.\n        (2) The Tribunal member may authorise the treatment on the basis of the application alone, without any hearing or further investigation.\n        (3) The treatment may be authorised unconditionally or on such conditions as to time, method, supervision or otherwise as the Tribunal member considers necessary or desirable and specifies in the authorisation.\n        (4) The Tribunal member is to advise the patient, the applicant and the Chief Psychiatrist of the authorisation without delay, and this may be done by any means of communication the Tribunal member considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n        (5) However, if the advice of the authorisation is given orally, the Tribunal member is to confirm it in writing by means of a form approved by the President of the Tribunal.\n        (6) The Tribunal member or the Tribunal may revoke or vary the authorisation at any time.\n        (7) The Tribunal member or the Tribunal, as the case may be, is to advise the patient, applicant and Chief Psychiatrist of the revocation or variation of the authorisation without delay, and this may be done by any means of communication the Tribunal member or Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n        (8) However, if the advice of the revocation or variation of the authorisation is given orally, the Tribunal member or the Tribunal, as the case may be, is to confirm it in writing by means of a form approved by the President of the Tribunal.\n        (9) Subject to subsection (6) , the authorisation continues in effect according to its terms until the relevant application is determined by the Tribunal.\n        (10) However, the authorisation lapses after 14 days (calculated from the precise time it is given) if, by then, the Tribunal has not determined the relevant application.\n        (11) Once an advice under subsection (4) or (7) has been put in writing, the Tribunal member or the Tribunal, as the case may be, is to –\n                (a) give a copy of the advice to the patient (together with a statement of rights in a form approved by the President of the Tribunal); and\n                (b) give a copy of the advice to –\n                        (i) the applicant; and\n                        (ii) the Chief Psychiatrist.\n\n                Note\n            The authorisation of treatment for a forensic patient is reviewable by the Tribunal – see Division 2 of Part 3 of Chapter 3 .\n\nDivision 3 - Force, seclusion and restraint\n\n92.

Power of direct intervention\n        (1) The Chief Psychiatrist has, in prescribed matters within his or her jurisdiction, the power to intervene directly with regard to the assessment, treatment and care of any patient.\n\n                Note\n            The exercise of the Chief Psychiatrist's power of intervention is reviewable by the Tribunal– see Division 2 of Part 3 of Chapter 3 .\n        (2) The power of intervention is exercisable –\n                (a) on the Chief Psychiatrist's own motion; or\n                (b) at the request of the patient; or\n                (c) at the request of any person who, in the opinion of the Chief Psychiatrist, has a proper interest in the patient's health, safety or welfare.\n        (3) However, the power of intervention is only exercisable if the Chief Psychiatrist –\n                (a) has made inquiries into the relevant prescribed matter; and\n                (b) is satisfied from those inquiries that intervention is essential to the patient's health, safety or welfare.\n        (4) The power of intervention is exercisable by giving any person responsible for the treatment and care of the patient, as regards the relevant prescribed matter, a notice to do one or more of the following:\n                (a) discontinue or alter a particular practice, procedure or treatment in respect of the patient;\n                (b) observe or carry out a particular practice, procedure or treatment in respect of the patient.\n        (5) The Chief Psychiatrist, by the same or a different notice, may also do either or both of the following:\n                (a) issue consequential directions for the future assessment, treatment or care of the patient;\n                (b) direct that any decision triggering or relating to the intervention be referred, by a specified person, to the Tribunal for review within a specified time.\n\n                Note\n            For the review of such decisions by the Tribunal – see Division 2 of Part 3 of Chapter 3 .\n        (6) Nothing in this section is to be taken as authorising the Chief Psychiatrist to issue directions that are repugnant to –\n                (a) any provision of this Act; or\n                (b) a provision of any other Act; or\n                (c) an order, determination or direction of the Tribunal or any court.\n        (7) A failure by an individual to comply with a direction contained in a notice issued by the Chief Psychiatrist under this section is not an offence but does constitute proper grounds for instituting professional or, as the case may be, occupational disciplinary action against that individual.\n        (8) In this section –\n            prescribed matters means the following:\n                    (a) the use of seclusion;\n                    (b) the use of restraint;\n                    (c) the use of force;\n                    (d) the granting, refusal and control of leaves of absence;\n                    (e) the giving or withholding of patient information;\n                    (f) the granting, denial and control of visiting, correspondence and telephone rights;\n                    (g) assessment and treatment generally;\n                    (ga) whether the mental health service delivery principles, set out in Schedule 1 , have been considered when exercising a responsibility under this Act;\n                    (h) matters prescribed by the regulations.\n\n148. Independence\n    Notwithstanding the State Service Act 2000 , in acting or forming any opinion in clinical matters the Chief Psychiatrist is not subject to the direction of the Minister or any other person.\n\n149. Delegation\n        (1) The Chief Psychiatrist may delegate any of his or her powers or functions under this or any other Act other than –\n                (a) this power of delegation; and\n                (b) the power to issue, vary or revoke clinical guidelines and standing orders; and\n                (c) any powers or functions under Part 6 of Chapter 2 .\n        (2) However, under subsection (1) , a restricted professional power, or a function necessary or incidental to the exercise of a restricted professional power, must not be delegated to anyone other than a medical practitioner.\n        (3) In this section –\n            restricted professional power means a power to –\n                    (a)\n                    (b) authorise seclusion or restraint, or an extension of a period of seclusion or restraint, under section 56 or 57 or section 94 or 95 ; or\n                    (c) direct under section 59 or Division 3 of Part 4 of Chapter 2 the transfer of patients to secure institutions, approved hospitals, a health service within the meaning of the Health Complaints Act 1995 or premises where such a service is provided; or\n                    (d) make a decision about admitting an involuntary patient to, or detaining an involuntary patient at, an SMHU under section 63 or 64 ; or\n                    (e) make a decision about the transfer of a prisoner or a detainee to an SMHU pursuant to section 36A(2) or (3) of the Corrections Act 1997 or section 134A(2) or (3) of the Youth Justice Act 1997 ; or\n                    (f) make a decision under section 70 to return a person to the custody of a responsible authority; or\n                    (g) make a decision under Division 5 or 6 of Part 4 of Chapter 2 .\n\n150.

Standing orders\n        (1) The Chief Psychiatrist may issue directions (standing orders) to controlling authorities, medical practitioners, nurses or other persons regarding the exercise of their responsibilities in respect of any clinical or non-clinical procedure or matter under –\n                (a) provisions of this Act; and\n                (b) provisions of other Acts in respect of which the Chief Psychiatrist may have responsibilities.\n\n                Note 1\n            The Chief Psychiatrist must, however, ensure that there are standing orders in relation to the seclusion and restraint of involuntary patients – see section 57(5) and section 56(4A) .\n\n                Note 2\n            The Chief Psychiatrist must, however, ensure that there are standing orders in relation to the seclusion and restraint of involuntary forensic patients – see section 94(5) and section 95(5) .\n        (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) , the standing orders may indicate how a provision of this or another Act ought to be applied in a practical clinical or forensic setting.\n        (3) To avoid doubt, the specific mention of standing orders in certain provisions of this or another Act does not preclude them from being issued and applied to other provisions where they are not mentioned if the Chief Psychiatrist considers there are reasonable grounds to do so.\n        (4) A person exercising, under this or another Act, responsibilities in respect of a matter for which standing orders have been issued must comply with those standing orders.\n        (5) A failure by an individual to comply with standing orders is not an offence but does constitute proper grounds for instituting professional or, as the case may be, occupational disciplinary action against that individual.\n\n153. Matters common to clinical guidelines and standing orders\n        (1) Clinical guidelines and standing orders –\n                (a) are to be written in plain language with a minimum of technical and professional jargon; and\n                (b) are to be as brief as possible consistent with their intended application; and\n                (c) are to clearly state which legislative provisions they relate to; and\n                (d) are to follow a standard style and format; and\n                (e) may be made so as to apply differently according to such matters, limitations or restrictions, whether as to time, location, circumstance or otherwise, as are specified in them; and\n                (f) may confer responsibilities and discretionary responsibilities on persons (including the Chief Psychiatrist) and provide for the delegation of those responsibilities; and\n                (g) may not purport to impose fines or other penalties for any failure to comply with them; and\n                (h) may not contain provisions that are repugnant to the other provisions of this or any other Act; and\n                (i) may not purport to authorise anyone to disregard or act contrary to a judicial order or an order of a tribunal.\n        (2) In the event that the provisions of any clinical guidelines or standing orders are inconsistent with the provisions of any Act, the provisions of the Act always prevail.\n        (3) To avoid overlap, ambiguity or inconsistency, the Chief Psychiatrist is to liaise with the Tribunal when drafting any clinical guidelines or standing orders.\n        (4) Clinical guidelines and standing orders are to be published, in the manner the Chief Psychiatrist considers necessary or desirable having regard to their intended application.\n        (5) No fee is chargeable or payable for issuing, supplying or obtaining a copy of any clinical guidelines or standing orders.\n        (6) The Chief Psychiatrist is to give the Tribunal a copy of any issued or draft clinical guidelines or standing orders on request.\n        (7) Clinical guidelines and standing orders are not –\n                (a) statutory rules; or\n                (b) instruments of a legislative character for the purposes of the Subordinate Legislation Act 1992 .\n        (8) To avoid doubt, clinical guidelines and standing orders are instruments to which section 22 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 applies.\n\nPART 2 - Official Visitors\n\nDivision 1 - Preliminary\n\n154.
