Stay and transfer of proceedings\n        (1) If proceedings instituted under this Act by or in relation to a person are pending in a court and it appears to the court that other proceedings under this Act instituted by or in relation to the same person are pending in another court, the court may –\n                (a) stay the proceedings pending before it for any period it considers fit; or\n                (b) dismiss the proceedings.\n        (2) If proceedings instituted under this Act are pending in a court and it appears to the court that it is in the interests of justice that the proceedings be dealt with in another court, the court may transfer the proceedings to the other court.\n\n33. Transfer of proceedings from Magistrates Court\n        (1) The Magistrates Court is to transfer any proceedings relating to an interest in property of a value exceeding the amount prescribed under section 7 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Act 1992 to the Supreme Court, unless the parties agree to the Magistrates Court hearing and determining the proceedings.\n        (2) If proceedings referred to in subsection (1) are before it, the Magistrates Court may transfer the proceedings of its own motion, notwithstanding that the parties are willing for the Magistrates Court to hear and determine the proceedings.\n        (3) Before transferring proceedings, the Magistrates Court may make any orders it considers necessary pending the disposal of the proceedings by the Supreme Court.\n        (4) If proceedings are transferred to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court is to proceed as if the proceedings had been originally instituted in that Court.\n        (5) Failure by the Magistrates Court to comply with this section does not invalidate any order of that Court in the proceedings.\n\n34. Transfer of proceedings from Supreme Court\n        (1) The Supreme Court may transfer any proceedings under this Act relating to an interest in property to the Magistrates Court if –\n                (a) the value of that interest is less than or equal to the amount prescribed under section 7 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Act 1992; or\n                (b) the value of that interest is in excess of that prescribed amount and the parties agree to the Magistrates Court hearing and determining the proceedings.\n        (2) The Supreme Court may transfer any proceedings under this Act relating to maintenance.\n\n35. Courts aiding each other\n    Courts are to act severally in aid of, and be auxiliary to, each other in all matters under this Act.\n\nPART 5 - Proceedings for financial adjustment and maintenance\n\nDivision 1 - Preliminary\n\n36. Application for adjustment or maintenance\n        (1) A partner may apply to a court for an order for the adjustment of interests with respect to the property of either or both of the partners or for the granting of maintenance, or both.\n        (2) The application may be made whether or not any other application for any remedy or relief is or may be made under this Act or any other Act or law.\n\n37. Prerequisites for making of order\n        (1) Subject to subsection (2) , a court is not to make an order unless satisfied that the partners referred to in an application under section 36(1) have been in a personal relationship for a continuous period of not less than 2 years.\n        (2) A court may make an order if satisfied that –\n                (a) there is a child of the partners referred to in the application; or\n                (b) the applicant –\n                        (i) has made substantial contributions of the kind referred to in section 40(1) for which the applicant would otherwise not be adequately compensated if the order were not made; or\n                        (ii) has the care and control of a child of the respondent –\n                and the failure to make the order would result in serious injustice to the applicant.\n        (3) This section does not apply if a deed of relationship has been registered in relation to the personal relationship.\n\n38. Time limit for making application\n        (1) If partners have ceased to be in a personal relationship, an application to a court for an order under section 36(1) is to be made before the expiration of the period of 2 years after the day on which they ceased or last ceased to be in the relationship.\n        (2) A court, at any time before or after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (1) , may grant leave to a partner to apply to the court for an order if greater hardship would be caused to the applicant if that leave were not granted than would be caused to the respondent if that leave were granted.\n\n39. Order to end financial relationship\n    In proceedings for an order, a court, so far as is practicable, is to make an order that –\n            (a) finally determines the financial relationship between the partners; and\n            (b) avoids further proceedings between them.\n\nDivision 2 - Adjustment of interest in property\n\n40. Order for adjustment\n        (1) On an application by a partner for an order for the adjustment of interests in respect of the property of either or both the partners, a court may make any order it considers just and equitable having regard to –\n                (a) the financial and non-financial contributions made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of either or both of the partners to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property; and\n                (b) the financial resources of either or both of the partners; and\n                (c) the contributions, including any contributions made in the capacity of homemaker or parent, made by a partner to the welfare of the other partner or to the welfare of the family constituted by the partners and one or more of –\n                        (i) a child of the partners; or\n                        (ii) a child accepted by either or both the partners into the household of the partners, whether or not the child is a child of either of the partners; and\n                (d) the nature and duration of the relationship; and\n                (e) any relevant matter mentioned in section 47 .\n        (2) A court may make an order in respect of property whether or not it has declared the title or rights of a partner in respect of the property.\n\n41. Adjournment because of significant change in circumstances\n        (1) Without limiting the power of a court to grant an adjournment in relation to any proceedings before it, if, on an application by a partner for an order under section 40 , the court is of the opinion that –\n                (a) there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of either or both of the partners and that, having regard to when that change is likely to take place, it is reasonable to adjourn the proceedings; and\n                (b) an order that the court could make with respect to the property of either or both of the partners, if that significant change occurs, is more likely to do justice between the partners than an order that the court could make immediately with respect to the property of either or both of the partners –\n        the court, if requested by either partner, may adjourn the application for a specified period.\n        (2) Before adjourning an application under subsection (1) , the court may make any order it considers appropriate with respect to the property of either or both of the partners.\n        (3) A court, in forming an opinion for the purposes of subsection (1) , may have regard to –\n                (a) any change in the financial circumstances of a partner that may occur because of the vesting in either or both of the partners, or the use or application in or towards the purposes of either or both of the partners, of a financial resource of either or both of the partners; and\n                (b) any other circumstances the court considers appropriate.\n\n42. Adjournment because of proceedings in Family Court\n        (1) Without limiting the power of a court to grant an adjournment in relation to any proceedings before it, the court may adjourn the hearing of the application for an order under section 40 if, before the court has made a final order to adjust interests with respect to the property of either or both partners, proceedings in relation to the property are commenced in the Family Court of Australia.\n        (2) If the hearing of an application for an order is adjourned under subsection (1) , either partner may apply to the court for the hearing of the application to proceed.\n\n43. Deferment of order\n    If a court is of the opinion that a partner, in respect of the property of whom an order is made under section 40 , is likely to become entitled to property that may be applied in satisfaction of the order, the court may defer the operation of the order until the date or the occurrence of an event specified in the order.\n\n44. Death before order made\n        (1) If, before an application under section 40 is determined, either party to the application dies, the application may be continued by or against the legal personal representative of the deceased party.\n        (2) A court may make an order in respect of property if of the opinion that –\n                (a) it would have adjusted interests in respect of property if the deceased party had not died; and\n                (b) notwithstanding the death of the deceased party, it is still appropriate to adjust those interests.\n        (3) Any order may be enforced on behalf of, or against, the estate of the deceased party.\n\n45. Death after order made\n    If a party to a proceeding for an order under section 40 dies after the order is made in favour of, or against, that party, the order may be enforced on behalf of, or against, the estate of the deceased party.\n\nDivision 3 - Maintenance\n\n46. Right to maintenance\n    Subject to this Division –\n            (a) a partner is not liable to maintain the other partner; and\n            (b) a partner is not entitled to claim maintenance from the other partner.\n\n47. Order for maintenance\n        (1) On an application by a partner for an order for maintenance, a court may make the order if satisfied that the applicant is unable to support himself or herself adequately because –\n                (a) the partner's earning capacity has been adversely affected by the circumstances of the personal relationship; or\n                (b) of any other reason arising in whole or in part from the circumstances of the personal relationship.\n        (2) In determining whether to make the order and in fixing any amount to be paid under the order, a court is to have regard to the following:\n                (a) the income, property and financial resources of each partner (including the rate of any pension, allowance or benefit paid, payable or entitled to be paid to either partner) and the physical and mental capacity of each partner for appropriate gainful employment;\n                (b) the financial needs and obligations of each partner;\n                (c) the responsibilities of either partner to support any other person;\n                (d) the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 40 ;\n                (e) any payments provided for the maintenance of a child in the care and control of either partner;\n                (f) whether either partner has the care and control of a child of the partner who is under 18;\n                (g) the age and state of health of each partner;\n                (h) the standard of living that is reasonable for each partner in all the circumstances;\n                (i) the extent to which the payment of maintenance to the partner whose maintenance is under consideration would increase the earning capacity of the partner by enabling the partner –\n                        (i) to undertake a course of education or training; or\n                        (ii) to establish a business; or\n                        (iii) otherwise to obtain adequate income;\n                (j) the extent to which the partner whose maintenance is under consideration has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other partner;\n                (k) the length of the personal relationship;\n                (l) the extent to which the personal relationship has affected the earning capacity of the partner whose maintenance is under consideration;\n                (m) any other fact or circumstances the court considers relevant.\n        (3) In making an order for maintenance, a court is to disregard any entitlement of the person whose maintenance is under consideration to an income-tested pension, allowance or benefit.\n        (4) If, before an application is determined, either party to the application dies, the application abates.\n\n48. Interim maintenance\n    If, on an application by a partner for an order for maintenance, it appears to a court that the applicant is in immediate need of financial assistance but it is not practicable in the circumstances to determine immediately if any order should be made, the court may order the payment by the other partner, pending the disposal of the application, of any periodic sum or other sums the court considers reasonable.\n\n49. Subsequent relationship or marriage\n    If partners cease to be in a personal relationship, an application to a court for an order for maintenance may not be made by a partner who, at the time at which the application is made –\n            (a) is in a personal relationship with another person; or\n            (b) has married or remarried.\n\n50. Cessation of order\n        (1) An order for maintenance ceases to have effect –\n                (a) on the death of the partner in whose favour the order was made; or\n                (b) on the death of the partner against whom the order was made; or\n                (c) on the marriage or remarriage of the partner in whose favour the order was made to another person; or\n                (d) on the registration of a deed of relationship relating to the relationship of the partner in whose favour the order was made to another person.\n        (2) If a marriage, remarriage or registration of a deed of relationship takes place, the partner is to notify the partner against whom the order was made of the date of the marriage, remarriage or registration as soon as practicable.\n        (3) Any money paid under an order for periodic maintenance in respect of a period occurring after the marriage, remarriage or registration of a deed of relationship takes place may be recovered as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction by the partner who made the payment.\n        (4) If a notification under subsection (2) is not provided or reasonable steps are not taken to provide the notification, interest is payable on any money recovered under subsection (3) with effect from the date of the marriage, remarriage or registration of the deed of relationship.\n        (5) The rate of interest payable is the rate applicable in the relevant court.\n\n51. Recovery of arrears\n    The provisions of this Division do not affect the recovery of any arrears due under an order for maintenance when the order ceases to have effect.\n\n52. Variation of order for periodic maintenance\n        (1) On an application by a partner in respect of whom an order has been made for periodic maintenance, a court may –\n                (a) subject to subsection (2) , discharge the order; or\n                (b) suspend the operation of the order wholly or in part until –\n                        (i) a further order; or\n                        (ii) a fixed time; or\n                        (iii) the happening of a future event; or\n                (c) revive wholly or in part the operation of an order suspended under paragraph (b) ; or\n                (d) subject to subsection (2) , vary the terms of the order.\n        (2) A court is not to make an order discharging an order or increasing or decreasing an amount payable under an order unless satisfied that it is justifiable to do so because, since the order was made or last varied –\n                (a) the circumstances of the partner in whose favour the order was made have changed; or\n                (b) the circumstances of the partner against whom the order was made have changed; or\n                (c) the cost of living has changed.\n        (3) In satisfying itself for the purposes of subsection (2)(c) , a court is to have regard to any changes occurring during the relevant period in –\n                (a) the Consumer Price Index (All Groups Index) issued by the Australian Statistician; or\n                (b) a group of prescribed numbers or prescribed amounts relating to the price of goods and services issued by the Australian Statistician, other than those set out in the Index referred to in paragraph (a) .\n        (4) A court, in considering the variation of an order, is not to have regard to a change in the cost of living unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made or last varied.\n        (5) An order increasing or decreasing the amount of a periodic sum payable under an order may be expressed to be retrospective to any date the court thinks fit.\n        (6) For the purposes of this section, a court is to have regard to the provisions of sections 46 and 47 .\n\n53. Other maintenance orders not to be varied\n    Subject to section 57 , an order for maintenance, other than for periodic maintenance, is not to be varied.\n\nDivision 4 - General\n\n54.

Variation and setting aside of orders\n    If, on the application of a person in respect of whom an order referred to in section 40 or 47 is made, a court is satisfied that –\n            (a) there has been a miscarriage of justice because of fraud, duress, suppression of evidence, the giving of false evidence or any other circumstances; or\n            (b) it is impracticable for the order or part of the order to be carried out; or\n            (c) a person failed to carry out an obligation imposed on the person by the order –\n    the court may vary or set aside the order and make another order in substitution for the order set aside.\n\n58. Transactions to defeat claims\n        (1) If a court is satisfied that an existing or anticipated order in a proceeding under this Act is likely to be defeated by the making of a document or disposition by a party to the proceeding, the court may set aside or restrain the making of the document or disposition.\n        (2) If a court is satisfied that an existing or anticipated order in a proceeding under this Act was defeated by the making of a document or disposition by a party to the proceeding, the court may order that –\n                (a) any property dealt with by the document or disposition be applied towards, or charged with, payment of –\n                        (i) an amount payable under an order adjusting interests in the property of one or more of the parties to the proceeding; or\n                        (ii) costs; or\n                (b) the proceeds of a sale be paid into court to satisfy its order.\n        (3) A court may order a party or a person acting in collusion with a party to pay the costs of any other party, or of a genuine purchaser or other interested person, of and incidental to any document or disposition or the setting aside or restraining of the document or disposition.\n        (4) For the purpose of this section –\n                (a) something is made by a person if the thing is made by or on behalf of, or by direction or in the interests of, the person; and\n                (b) it does not matter that the document or disposition is intended to defeat the order concerned.\n\n59.
