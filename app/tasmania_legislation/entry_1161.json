Subsisting estates and interests to be recorded on qualified title\n        (1) When bringing land under this Act with qualified title, the Recorder shall record on the relevant folio of the Register any subsisting estate or interest then apparent to the Recorder, but shall not be concerned to make searches or inquiries as to the existence of any such interest.\n        (2) The Recorder may, at any time after the creation of a qualified title –\n                (a) if a general caution is recorded on the qualified title, record on that qualified title any additional subsisting estate or interest in the land comprised in the title; or\n                (b) if a particular caution is recorded on the qualified title, record on that qualified title any additional subsisting estate or interest the existence or probable or possible existence of which is indicated in the relevant Recorder's minute –\n        and, in either case, in such a manner as to preserve the priority that the additional estate or interest would have had if it had been recorded on the relevant folio of the Register when the land was first brought under this Act.\n\n23. Certain informal dealings may be registered\n    An instrument that affects any land brought under this Act and that might have been registered under the Registration of Deeds Act 1935 if the land had not been brought under this Act may, in the discretion of the Recorder, be registered under this Act notwithstanding that it is not an instrument in an approved form, and when registered has effect for all purposes as if it were such an instrument.\n\n24. Qualified title may be cancelled or corrected in certain circumstances\n        (1) If, on application made to the Recorder for that purpose, it appears to the Recorder that the proprietor of an estate or interest in the land comprised in a qualified title has suffered judgment for the recovery of the land or a declaration, injunction, or other judgment destructive of that proprietor's estate or interest wholly or in part, the Recorder –\n                (a) must cancel or correct the folio of the Register relating to that land; and\n                (b) must call in and cancel or correct the corresponding certificate of title, if any, as the circumstances may require.\n        (2) Subject to subsection (3) , a person who claims an estate of freehold in the whole or any part of the land comprised in a qualified title of which some other person is the registered proprietor may apply to have the land brought under this Act as if that qualified title had not been created, and the Recorder, if satisfied of the grounds of the applicants claim, shall –\n                (a) correct the folio of the Register; or\n                (b) cancel the folio of the Register constituting the qualified title and create a folio of the Register in the name of the applicant –\n        and shall call in the certificate of title, if any, corresponding to the corrected or cancelled folio of the Register and correct or cancel it as the circumstances require.\n        (3) Where a particular caution is recorded on a folio of the Register, a person may apply under subsection (2) only if the person claims an estate or interest the existence or probable or possible existence of which is indicated in the Recorder's minute or arising from a defect in title indicated in the minute.\n\n25. Caution to lapse after 20 years\n        (1) A caution lapses, unless it sooner ceases to have effect, at the expiration of a period of 20 years after the date on which the land was brought under this Act or the repealed Act .\n        (2) Where a caution lapses under this section the Recorder shall as soon as practicable cancel the caution.\n        (3) The lapsing of a caution under this section operates to free the land in respect of which it lapsed from any estates and interests that affected the land at the date on which it was brought under this Act or the repealed Act , except an estate or interest which is preserved by section 40 , section 46 , section 138W(4) or section 138X(4) or which was immediately before the lapsing –\n                (a) recorded on the relevant folio of the Register; or\n                (b) the subject of a caveat affecting the land comprised in that folio.\n\n26. Application of this Act to land in qualified title\n    The provisions of this Act apply in respect of land comprised in a qualified title in like manner as if that qualified title were a title to the land comprised in a folio of the Register upon which no caution is recorded except that –\n            (a) if a general caution is recorded on the qualified title and the caution has not lapsed, the land comprised in the title is subject to every estate and interest in the land created before the date on which the land was brought under this Act or the repealed Act ; and\n            (b) if a particular caution is recorded on the qualified title and the caution has not lapsed, the land comprised in the title is subject to any defect in title or any estate or interest of any person the existence or probable or possible existence of which is indicated in the Recorder's minute.\n\nDivision 5 - General provisions\n\n27. Land not alienated from the Crown may be brought under this Act\n    Land may be brought under this Act pursuant to Division 2 or Division 3 whether or not it has been alienated from the Crown and, where there appears to be no deed of grant or transfer from the Crown, no such deed or transfer is necessary before the Recorder brings the land under this Act.\n\n27A.

How certain estates and interests dealt with when land brought under this Act\n        (1AA) In this section,\n            instrument means any deed, judgment, will, letters of administration or other document or writing affecting or intended to affect land in this State.\n        (1) When –\n                (a) on the bringing of land under this Act, it appears to the Recorder that the land is subject to a legal mortgage by conveyance of the fee simple;\n                (b) a legal mortgage by conveyance of the fee simple is to be recorded in the Register pursuant to section 22 ; or\n                (c) in the case of land of the Crown for which a folio of the Register is created under section 27A (2) , it appears to the Recorder that the land is subject to a legal mortgage –\n        the Recorder shall register the mortgage on the relevant folio of the Register notwithstanding that it is not an instrument in the form of a memorandum of mortgage under this Act, and when so registered it has effect for all purposes as if it were such an instrument registered under this Act at the time the land was brought under this Act.\n        (2) Where –\n                (a) on the bringing of land under this Act, it appears to the Recorder that an instrument registered under the Registration of Deeds Act 1935 or Part 2K.2 of the Corporations Act creates an estate or interest in that land (other than the estate claimed by the person making application to bring land under this Act or the person who is to be registered as proprietor) that could have been created by an instrument registered under this Act if at the time of its creation the land were under this Act; or\n                (b) the Recorder is required to record the estate or interest referred to in paragraph (a) on the relevant folio of the Register pursuant to section 22 –\n            the Recorder may record that instrument as if it were the appropriate instrument under this Act to create the estate or interest, notwithstanding that –\n                (c) it is not in the form of an appropriate instrument; and\n                (d) it discloses the existence of other estates or interests that may not otherwise be registered under this Act.\n        (3) Subsection (2) allows the recording of an equitable mortgage or charge as a legal mortgage or encumbrance.\n        (4) Where an instrument is recorded on a folio of the Register pursuant to this section or is referred to on the folio –\n                (a) the Recorder shall –\n                        (i) certify on the instrument that it is so recorded;\n                        (ii) make a copy of the instrument, which the Recorder shall retain, and which shall for all purposes be deemed to be the original instrument; and\n                        (iii) return the instrument to the person from whom the Recorder received it, and that instrument shall be produced to the Recorder whenever the duplicate instrument is required by this Act to be produced to the Recorder;\n                (b) dealings with the estate or interest so recorded are subject to this Act; and\n                (c) the proprietor of the estate or interest so recorded has all the rights of a registered proprietor of such an estate or interest instead of any rights of a like nature enjoyed by the proprietor before that registration.\n        (5) Where an instrument is registered under the Registration of Deeds Act 1935 or Part 2K.2 of the Corporations Act, the Recorder is not bound to require production of the instrument or to comply with subsection (4) (a) (i) .\n        (6) In registering instruments under this section the Recorder shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, preserve such priority as they appear to have by virtue of the Registration of Deeds Act 1935 and for that purpose may assume that all instruments registered under that Act have been executed or taken in good faith by the purchasers.\n        (7) A power of sale arising from an instrument registered pursuant to this section shall be exercised, and the estate or interest sold shall be transferred, in accordance with this Act and not otherwise.\n        (8) Foreclosure of a mortgage registered pursuant to this section shall be effected by an application under section 85 and an order made and registered pursuant to section 86 , and not otherwise.\n        (9) Where a person is aggrieved by a decision of the Recorder –\n                (a) to register or refrain from registering an instrument under subsection (1) or subsection (2) ; or\n                (b) on the priority of an instrument so registered –\n        section 144 applies as if the decision were a refusal as mentioned in subsection (1) (a) of that section.\n        (10) Where –\n                (a) on the bringing of land under this Act, it appears to the Recorder that the land is subject to an equitable interest incapable of registration under this Act; or\n                (b) the Recorder is required under section 22 to record on a qualified title an equitable interest incapable of registration under this Act –\n        the Recorder shall record a caveat to protect the interest of the person entitled in equity and shall give notice of the caveat to that person and to the registered proprietor.\n        (11) A caveat recorded pursuant to subsection (10) –\n                (a) may be withdrawn by the Recorder, upon proof to the Recorders satisfaction that the equitable interest no longer exists, or by the person protected by the caveat; and\n                (b) is otherwise subject to the same provisions as if it were a caveat lodged by that person.\n        (12) Where –\n                (a) on the bringing of land under this Act, it appears to the Recorder that a judgment registered under the Registration of Deeds Act 1935 affects that land; or\n                (b) the Recorder is required under section 22 to record the interest of the judgment creditor under such a judgment –\n        the Recorder shall record a caveat to protect the interest of the judgment creditor, and shall give notice of the caveat to the judgment creditor or to the legal practitioner who registered the judgment, and to the registered proprietor.\n        (13) A caveat recorded pursuant to subsection (12) –\n                (a) may be withdrawn by the Recorder upon proof to the Recorders satisfaction that the judgment has been satisfied, or by the person to whom the money payable under the judgment is payable or by the persons legal practitioner for the person and on the persons behalf;\n                (b) unless sooner withdrawn or lapsed, lapses at the expiration of 5 years after the date of the first registration of the judgment, or the latest re-registration of the judgment before the land was brought under this Act, whichever is the later date; and\n                (c) is otherwise subject to the same provisions as if it were a caveat lodged by a judgment creditor.\n        (14) On recording an estate or interest referred to in subsection (2) , (10) or (12) , it is sufficient compliance with this section if the Recorder refers to an instrument registered under the Registration of Deeds Act 1935 which records that estate or interest, whether it was created in that instrument or in another instrument registered in the Registry of Deeds.\n\n28A. Restraining orders not affected when land brought under Act\n    If land that is brought under this Act is subject to a restraining order within the meaning of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1976 , the Recorder is to record particulars of the restraining order on the relevant folio of the Register.\n\n29. Notice to be given in Registry of Deeds\n    When land is brought under this Act (otherwise than pursuant to Division 1 or section 27A ), the Recorder shall give notice of that fact in the Registry of Deeds in the prescribed manner.\n\n30. Disposal of antecedent documents of title\n        (1) Where land is brought under this Act or the repealed Act , the Recorder –\n                (a) shall return to the person from whom the Recorder received them documents relating to any property other than the land included in the relevant folio of the Register; and\n                (b) may, in relation to any other documents –\n                        (i) retain them in the office of the Recorder;\n                        (ii) transfer them to the Tasmanian Library Board, to be dealt with as if they were State records within the meaning of the Archives Act 1983 ; or\n                        (iii) subject to subsection (2) , sell or destroy them.\n        (2) The Recorder shall not destroy a document pursuant to subsection (1) unless –\n                (a) where the land was brought under this Act or the repealed Act with a title other than a qualified title, a period of at least 12 years has expired since the land was brought under this Act or the repealed Act ; or\n                (b) where the land was brought under this Act or the repealed Act with a qualified title, the title has ceased to be qualified and a period of at least 12 years has expired since it ceased to be qualified.\n        (3) Instead of selling or destroying a document under the authority of subsection (1) , the Recorder may deliver it to any person who satisfies the Recorder that the person intends to preserve the document for historical purposes.\n        (3A) If an application is made by a person who had an estate or interest in the land specified in a document at the time that document was lodged or deposited with the Recorder, the Recorder shall, if the Recorder considers that the document is of no value for the purpose of the Register, give possession of the document to that person free of charge.\n        (4) Before selling, returning or delivering a document pursuant to this section, the Recorder shall mark the document as cancelled so far as it relates to land brought under this Act or the repealed Act .\n        (5) A person is not entitled to the production of a document retained by the Recorder, or transferred to the Tasmanian Library Board, pursuant to subsection (1) , except upon the order of the Recorder or of the Supreme Court.\n        (6) In this section, document means, in relation to land brought under this Act or the repealed Act , an instrument constituting, or in any way affecting, the title to the land, being an instrument that is left with or surrendered to the Recorder by the applicant or any other person, other than an instrument that is registered pursuant to section 28 .\n\n31.

First mortgagee or encumbrancee to produce title for registration of subsequent dealing\n    When a dealing subsequent to a first mortgage or encumbrance is made, the first mortgagee or encumbrancee, if the first mortgagee or encumbrancee, respectively, holds the certificate of title, if any, or the duplicate registered dealing, if any, evidencing title to the land affected, shall, upon being requested to do so by the person entitled to the benefit of the subsequent dealing but at the cost of that person, produce the certificate of title, if any, or duplicate registered dealing, if any, to the Recorder so that the subsequent dealing may be registered.\n\n88.

Powers of Supreme Court to direct cancellation of folio or recording in certain cases\n    On the recovery of any land, estate, or interest, by any legal proceeding, from the person registered as proprietor of the land, the Supreme Court in any case in which that proceeding is not expressly barred by section 149 may direct the Recorder to cancel any folio of the Register, certificate of title, grant, or registered dealing, or any recording in the Register relating to that land, and to substitute a new folio, certificate of title, or recording, as the circumstances of the case may require, and the Recorder shall give effect to that order.\n\n142.
