Action to be for the benefit of certain relations\n    Every such action shall be for the benefit of the members of the family of the persons whose death shall have been so caused, and, subject to this Act, shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased; and in every such action the jury may give such damages as they may think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought; and the amount so recovered, after deducting the costs not recovered from the defendant, shall be divided amongst the parties aforesaid in such shares as the jury by their verdicts shall find and direct.\n\n6.

Payment into court without division\n        (1) In any action brought under the provisions of this Act it shall be sufficient, if the defendant is advised to pay money into court, that he pay it as compensation in one sum to all persons entitled under this Act for his wrongful act, neglect, or default, without specifying the shares into which it is to be divided by the jury.\n        (2) If the sum so paid into court is not accepted, and an issue is taken by the plaintiff as to its sufficiency, and the jury shall think the sum sufficient, the defendant shall be entitled to the verdict upon that issue.\n\n10.
