Unfavourable witness\n                                                (1) A party who called a witness, with the leave of the court, may question the witness as though the party were cross-examining the witness about –\n                                                        (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party; or\n                                                        (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence; or\n                                                        (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.\n                                                (2) Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act, other than section 39 .\n                                                (3) The party questioning the witness under this section, with the leave of the court, may question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness's credibility.\n                                                (4) Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs.\n                                                (5) If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs.\n                                                (6) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction, it is to take into account –\n                                                        (a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave; and\n                                                        (b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party.\n                                                (7) A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if –\n                                                        (a) a proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person; and\n                                                        (b) the party is a witness in the proceeding.\n\n                                        39.

Witness called in error\n                                            A party is not to cross-examine a witness who has been called in error by another party and has not been questioned by that other party about a matter relevant to a question to be determined in the proceeding.\n\n                                        41. Improper questions\n                                                (1) The court must disallow a question put to a witness in cross-examination, or inform the witness that it need not be answered, if the court is of the opinion that the question (referred to as a \"disallowable question\") –\n                                                        (a) is misleading or confusing; or\n                                                        (b) is unduly annoying, harassing, intimidating, offensive, oppressive, humiliating or repetitive; or\n                                                        (c) is put to the witness in a manner or tone that is belittling, insulting or otherwise inappropriate; or\n                                                        (d) has no basis other than a stereotype (for example, a stereotype based on the witness's sex, race, culture, ethnicity, age or mental, intellectual or physical disability).\n                                                (2) Without limiting the matters the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1) , it is to take into account –\n                                                        (a) any relevant condition or characteristic of the witness of which the court is, or is made, aware, including age, education, ethnic and cultural background, gender, language background and skills, level of maturity and understanding and personality; and\n                                                        (b) any mental, intellectual or physical disability of which the court is, or is made, aware and to which the witness is, or appears to be, subject; and\n                                                        (c) the context in which the question is put, including –\n                                                                (i) the nature of the proceeding; and\n                                                                (ii) in a criminal proceeding, the nature of the offence to which the proceeding relates; and\n                                                                (iii) the relationship (if any) between the witness and any other party to the proceeding.\n                                                (3) A question is not a disallowable question merely because –\n                                                        (a) the question challenges the truthfulness of the witness or the consistency or accuracy of any statement made by the witness; or\n                                                        (b) the question requires the witness to discuss a subject that could be considered distasteful to, or private by, the witness.\n                                                (4) A party may object to a question put to a witness on the ground that it is a disallowable question.\n                                                (5) However, the duty imposed on the court by this section applies whether or not an objection is raised to a particular question.\n                                                (6) A failure by the court to disallow a question under this section, or to inform the witness that it need not be answered, does not affect the admissibility in evidence of any answer given by the witness in response to the question.\n\n                                        42. Leading questions\n                                                (1) A party may put a leading question to a witness in cross-examination unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it.\n                                                (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to disallow the question or give such a direction, it is to take into account the extent to which –\n                                                        (a) evidence that has been given by the witness in examination in chief is unfavourable to the party calling the witness; and\n                                                        (b) the witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner; and\n                                                        (c) the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter; and\n                                                        (d) the witness's age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness's answers.\n                                                (3) The court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.\n                                                (4) This section does not limit the court's power to control leading questions.\n\n                                        43. Prior inconsistent statement of witness\n                                                (1) A witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness whether or not –\n                                                        (a) complete particulars of the statement have been given to the witness; or\n                                                        (b) a document containing a record of the statement has been shown to the witness.\n                                                (2) If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner –\n                                                        (a) informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement; and\n                                                        (b) drew the witness's attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness's evidence.\n                                                (3) For the purpose of adducing evidence of the statement, a party may re-open the party's case.\n\n                                        44. Previous representation of other person\n                                                (1) Except as provided by this section, a cross-examiner must not question a witness about a previous representation alleged to have been made by a person other than the witness.\n                                                (2) A cross-examiner may question a witness about the representation and its contents if –\n                                                        (a) evidence of the representation has been admitted; or\n                                                        (b) the court is satisfied that it will be admitted.\n                                                (3) If subsection (2) does not apply and the representation is contained in a document, the document may only be used to question a witness as follows:\n                                                        (a) the document must be produced to the witness;\n                                                        (b) if the document is a tape recording, or any other kind of document from which sounds are reproduced, the witness must be provided with the means to listen to the contents of the document without other persons present at the cross-examination hearing those contents;\n                                                        (c) the witness must be asked whether, having examined or heard the contents of the document, the witness stands by the evidence that he or she has given;\n                                                        (d) neither the cross-examiner nor the witness is to identify the document or disclose any of its contents.\n                                                (4) A document that is so used may be marked for identification.\n\n                                        45. Production of document\n                                                (1) This section applies if a party is cross-examining or has cross-examined a witness about –\n                                                        (a) a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness that is recorded in a document; or\n                                                        (b) a previous representation alleged to have been made by another person that is recorded in a document.\n                                                (2) If the court so orders or if another party so requires, the party must produce –\n                                                        (a) the document; or\n                                                        (b) such evidence of the contents of the document as is available to the party –\n                                                to the court or to that other party.\n                                                (3) The court may –\n                                                        (a) examine a document or evidence that has been produced under subsection (2) ; and\n                                                        (b) give directions as to its use; and\n                                                        (c) admit it even if it has not been tendered by a party.\n                                                (4) Subsection (3) does not permit the court to admit a document or evidence that is not admissible because of Chapter 3 .\n                                                (5) The mere production of a document to a witness being cross-examined does not give rise to a requirement that the cross-examiner tender the document.\n\n                                        46. Leave to recall witnesses\n                                                (1) The court may give leave to a party to recall a witness to give evidence about a matter raised by evidence adduced by another party being a matter on which the witness was not cross-examined, if the evidence concerned has been admitted and –\n                                                        (a) it contradicts evidence about the matter given by the witness in examination in chief; or\n                                                        (b) the witness could have given evidence about the matter in examination in chief.\n                                                (2) A reference in this section to a matter raised by evidence adduced by another party includes a reference to an inference drawn from, or that the party intends to draw from, that evidence.\n\n                                        PART 2 - Documents\n\n                                        47. Interpretation of Part\n                                            In this Part –\n                                                    (a) a reference to a document in question is a reference to a document as to the contents of which it is sought to adduce evidence; and\n                                                    (b) a reference to a copy of a document in question includes a reference to a document that is not an exact copy of the document in question but that is identical to the document in question in all relevant respects.\n\n                                        48. Proof of contents of document\n                                                (1) A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question by tendering it or by any one or more of the following methods:\n                                                        (a) adducing evidence of an admission made by another party to the proceeding as to the contents of the document in question;\n                                                        (b) tendering a document that –\n                                                                (i) is, or purports to be, a copy of the document in question; and\n                                                                (ii) has been produced, or purports to have been produced, by a device that reproduces the contents of documents;\n                                                        (c) if the document in question is an article or thing by which words are recorded in such a way as to be capable of being reproduced as sound, or in which words are recorded in a code, including shorthand writing, tendering a document that is, or purports to be, a transcript of the words;\n                                                        (d) if the document in question is an article or thing on or in which information is stored in such a way that it cannot be used by the court unless a device is used to retrieve, produce or collate it, tendering a document that was, or purports to have been, produced by use of the device;\n                                                        (e) tendering a document that –\n                                                                (i) forms part of the records of or kept by a business, whether or not the business is still in existence; and\n                                                                (ii) is, or purports to be a copy of, or an extract from or a summary of, the document in question, or is, or purports to be, a copy of such an extract or summary;\n                                                        (f) if the document in question is a public document, tendering a document that is, or purports to be, a copy of the document in question and that is, or purports to have been, printed –\n                                                                (i) by a person authorised by or on behalf of the government to print the document or by the Government Printer of the Commonwealth or by the government or official printer of another State or a Territory; or\n                                                                (ii) by the authority of the Government or administration of the State, the Commonwealth, another State, a Territory or a foreign country; or\n                                                                (iii) by authority of an Australian Parliament, a House of an Australian Parliament, a committee of such a House or a committee of an Australian Parliament.\n                                                (2) Subsection (1) applies to a document in question whether it is available to the party or not.\n                                                (3) If the party adduces evidence of the contents of a document under subsection (1)(a) , the evidence may only be used –\n                                                        (a) in respect of the party's case against the other party who made the admission concerned; or\n                                                        (b) in respect of the other party's case against the party who adduced the evidence in that way.\n                                                (4) A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question that is not available to the party, or the existence and contents of which are not in issue in the proceeding, by –\n                                                        (a) tendering a document that is a copy of, or an extract from or a summary of, the document in question; or\n                                                        (b) adducing oral evidence of the contents of the document in question.\n\n                                        49.

Proof of voluminous or complex documents\n                                                (1) The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the party may adduce evidence of the contents of 2 or more documents in question in the form of a summary if the court is satisfied that it would not otherwise be possible conveniently to examine the evidence because of the volume or complexity of the documents in question.\n                                                (2) The court may only make a direction if the party seeking to adduce the evidence in the form of a summary –\n                                                        (a) has served on each other party a copy of the summary that discloses the name and address of the person who prepared the summary; and\n                                                        (b) has given each other party a reasonable opportunity to examine or copy the documents in question.\n                                                (3) The opinion rule does not apply to evidence adduced in accordance with a direction under this section.\n\n                                        51. Original document rule abolished\n                                            The principles and rules of the common law that relate to the means of proving the contents of documents are abolished.\n\n                                        PART 3 - Other evidence\n\n                                        52. Adducing of other evidence not affected\n                                            This Act, other than this Part, does not affect the operation of any Australian law or rule of practice so far as it permits evidence to be adduced in a way other than by witnesses giving evidence or documents being tendered in evidence.\n\n                                        53. Views\n                                                (1) A judge, on application, may order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.\n                                                (2) A judge is not to make an order unless satisfied that –\n                                                        (a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present; and\n                                                        (b) if there is a jury, the jury will be present.\n                                                (3) Without limiting the matters that a judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:\n                                                        (a) whether the parties will be present;\n                                                        (b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection, in the court's opinion, will assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence;\n                                                        (c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time;\n                                                        (d) in the case of a demonstration, the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated;\n                                                        (e) in the case of an inspection, the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.\n                                                (4) The court, including the jury if there is a jury, is not to conduct an experiment in the course of its deliberations.\n                                                (5) This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.\n                                                Note: Subsection (2) differs from section 53(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 of the Commonwealth.\n                                                                                                                                             \n                                                \n\n                                            54. Views to be evidence\n                                                The court, including the jury if there is a jury, may draw any reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices during a demonstration, experiment or inspection.\n\n                                            Chapter 3 - Admissibility of evidence\n\n                                            PART 1 - Relevance\n\n                                            55. Relevant evidence\n                                                    (1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.\n                                                    (2) Evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to –\n                                                            (a) the credibility of a witness; or\n                                                            (b) the admissibility of other evidence; or\n                                                            (c) a failure to adduce evidence.\n\n                                            56. Relevant evidence admissible\n                                                    (1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding.\n                                                    (2) Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.\n\n                                            57. Provisional relevance\n                                                    (1) If the determination of the question whether evidence adduced by a party is relevant depends on the court making another finding, including a finding that the evidence is what the party claims it to be, the court may find that the evidence is relevant –\n                                                            (a) if it is reasonably open to make that finding; or\n                                                            (b) subject to further evidence being admitted at a later stage of the proceeding that will make it reasonably open to make that finding.\n                                                    (2) Without limiting subsection (1) , if the relevance of evidence of an act done by a person depends on the court making a finding that the person and one or more other persons had, or were acting in furtherance of, a common purpose, whether to effect an unlawful conspiracy or otherwise, the court may use the evidence itself in determining whether the common purpose existed.\n\n                                            58. Inference as to relevance\n                                                    (1) If a question arises as to the relevance of a document or thing, the court may examine it and may draw any reasonable inference from it, including an inference as to its authenticity or identity.\n                                                    (2) Subsection (1) does not limit the matters from which inferences may properly be drawn.\n\n                                            PART 2 - Hearsay\n\n                                            Division 1 - Hearsay rule\n\n                                            59. Hearsay rule – exclusion of hearsay evidence\n                                                    (1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation.\n                                                    (2) Such a fact is referred to in this Part as an asserted fact.\n                                                    (2A) For the purposes of determining under subsection (1) whether it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert a particular fact by the representation, the court may have regard to the circumstances in which the representation was made.\n                                                    (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to evidence of a representation contained in a certificate or other document given or made under regulations made under an Act other than this Act to the extent to which the regulations provide that the certificate or other document has evidentiary effect.\n\n                                            60. Exception: evidence relevant for non-hearsay purpose\n                                                    (1) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of an asserted fact.\n                                                    (2) This section applies whether or not the person who made the representation had personal knowledge of the asserted fact (within the meaning of section 62(2) ).\n                                                    (3) However, this section does not apply in a criminal proceeding to evidence of an admission.\n\n                                            61. Exception to hearsay rule dependent on competency\n                                                    (1) This Part does not enable use of a previous representation to prove the existence of an asserted fact if, when the representation was made, the person who made it was not competent to give evidence about the fact because of section 13(1) .\n                                                    (2) This section does not apply to a contemporaneous representation made by a person about his or her health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind.\n                                                    (3) For the purpose of this section, it is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that when the representation was made the person who made it was competent to give evidence about the asserted fact.\n\n                                            Division 2 - First-hand hearsay\n\n                                            62. Restriction to first-hand hearsay\n                                                    (1) A reference in this Division, other than in subsection (2) , to a previous representation is a reference to a previous representation that was made by a person who had personal knowledge of an asserted fact.\n                                                    (2) A person has personal knowledge of the asserted fact if his or her knowledge of the fact was, or might reasonably be supposed to have been, based on something that the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived, other than a previous representation made by another person about the fact.\n                                                    (3) For the purposes of section 66A , a person has personal knowledge of the asserted fact if it is a fact about the person's health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind at the time the representation referred to in that section was made.\n\n                                            63. Exception: civil proceedings if maker not available\n                                                    (1) This section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.\n                                                    (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to –\n                                                            (a) evidence of the representation given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made; or\n                                                            (b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.\n\n                                            64. Exception: civil proceedings if maker available\n                                                    (1) This section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact.\n                                                    (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to –\n                                                            (a) evidence of the representation given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made; or\n                                                            (b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation –\n                                                    if it would cause undue expense or undue delay, or would not be reasonably practicable, to call the person who made the representation to give evidence.\n                                                    (3) If the person who made the representation has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation given by –\n                                                            (a) that person; or\n                                                            (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made.\n                                                    (4) A document containing a representation to which subsection (3) applies must not be tendered before the conclusion of the examination in chief of the person who made the representation, unless the court gives leave.\n\n                                            65. Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available\n                                                    (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.\n                                                    (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation –\n                                                            (a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind; or\n                                                            (b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or\n                                                            (c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable; or\n                                                            (d) was –\n                                                                    (i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made; and\n                                                                    (ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.\n                                                    (3) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied –\n                                                            (a) cross-examined the person who made the representation about it;

Requirements for notices\n                                                    Any notice under section 97 or 98 is to be given in accordance with any regulations or rules of court made for the purposes of this section.\n\n                                                100. Court may dispense with notice requirements\n                                                        (1) The court, on the application of a party, may direct that the tendency rule is not to apply to particular tendency evidence despite the party's failure to give notice under section 97 .\n                                                        (2) The court, on the application of a party, may direct that the coincidence rule is not to apply to particular coincidence evidence despite the party's failure to give notice under section 98 .\n                                                        (3) The application may be made either before or after the time by which the party would, apart from this section, be required to give, or to have given, the notice.\n                                                        (4) In a civil proceeding, the party's application may be made without notice of it having been given to one or more of the other parties.\n                                                        (5) The direction –\n                                                                (a) is subject to such conditions, if any, the court thinks fit; and\n                                                                (b) may be given either at or before the hearing.\n                                                        (6) Without limiting the court's power to impose conditions under this section, those conditions may include one or more of the following:\n                                                                (a) a condition that the party give notice of its intention to adduce the evidence to a specified party or to each other party, other than a specified party;\n                                                                (b) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified tendency evidence or all tendency evidence that the party intends to adduce, other than specified tendency evidence;\n                                                                (c) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified coincidence evidence or all coincidence evidence that the party intends to adduce, other than specified coincidence evidence.\n\n                                                101. Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by the prosecution\n                                                        (1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98 .\n                                                        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\n                                                        (3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.\n                                                        (4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.\n                                                        (5) . . . . . . . .\n\n                                                PART 7 - Credibility\n\n                                                Division 1 - Credibility evidence\n\n                                                101A.
