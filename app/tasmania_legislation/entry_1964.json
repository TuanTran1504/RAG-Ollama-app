Rules for determining existence of partnership\n    In determining whether a partnership, other than an incorporated limited partnership, does or does not exist, regard shall be had to the following rules:\n            (a) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property, common property, or part ownership, does not of itself create a partnership as to anything so held or owned, whether the tenants or owners do or do not share any profits made by the use thereof;\n            (b) The sharing of gross returns does not of itself create a partnership, whether the persons sharing such returns have or have not a joint or common right or interest in any property from which, or from the use of which, the returns are derived; and\n            (c) The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business; but the receipt of such a share, or of a payment contingent on or varying with the profits of a business, does not of itself make him a partner in the business; and, in particular–\n                    (i) the receipt by a person of a debt or other liquidated amount by instalments or otherwise out of the accruing profits of a business does not of itself make him a partner in the business or liable as such;\n                    (ii) a contract for the remuneration of a servant or agent of a person engaged in a business by a share of the profits of the business does not of itself make the servant or agent a partner in the business, or liable as such;\n                    (iii) a person being the spouse or child of a deceased partner, and receiving by way of annuity a portion of the profits made in the business in which the deceased person was a partner, is not by reason only of such receipt a partner in the business, or liable as such;\n                    (iiia) a person who, at the time of the death of a partner in a business, was in a caring relationship, which was the subject of a deed of relationship registered under Part 2 of the Relationships Act 2003 , with that partner, and who receives by way of annuity a portion of the profits made in the business in which the deceased person was a partner, is not by reason only of such receipt a partner in the business, or liable as such;\n                    (iv) the advance of money by way of loan to a person engaged or about to engage in any business on a contract with that person that the lender shall receive a rate of interest varying with the profits, or shall receive a share of the profits arising from carrying on the business, does not of itself make the lender a partner with the person carrying on the business or liable as such, provided that the contract is in writing, and signed by or on behalf of all the parties thereto; and\n                    (v) a person receiving by way of annuity or otherwise a portion of the profits of a business in consideration of the sale by him of the goodwill of the business is not by reason only of such receipt a partner in the business, or liable as such.\n\n8. Postponement of rights of person lending or selling in consideration of share of profits in case of insolvency of borrower or purchaser\n    In the event of any person to whom money has been advanced by way of loan upon such a contract as is mentioned in section seven , or of any buyer of a goodwill in consideration of a share of the profits of the business, being adjudged a bankrupt, entering into an arrangement to pay his creditors less than one hundred cents in the dollar, or dying in insolvent circumstances, the lender of the loan shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of his loan, and the seller of the goodwill shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of the share of profits contracted for, until the claims of the other creditors of the borrower or buyer for valuable consideration in money or money's worth have been satisfied.\n\n9. Meaning of firm\n    Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are for the purposes of this Act called collectively a firm, and the name under which their business is carried on is called the firm-name.\n\nDivision 2 - Relationships of partners to persons dealing with them\n\n10. Power of partner to bind partnership\n        (1) Every partner in a partnership, other than a limited partnership or an incorporated limited partnership, is an agent of the partnership and of the other partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership.\n        (2) Any act of a partner in a partnership, other than a limited partnership or an incorporated limited partnership, done for carrying on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership and the other partners, unless –\n                (a) the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter; and\n                (b) the person with whom he or she is dealing either –\n                        (i) knows that the partner has no such authority; or\n                        (ii) does not know or believe the partner to be a partner.\n        (3) Every general partner in a limited partnership or an incorporated limited partnership is an agent of the partnership and of the other general partners for the purpose of the business of the partnership.\n        (4) Any act of a general partner in a limited partnership or an incorporated limited partnership, done for carrying on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the limited partnership, binds the partnership and the other general partners, unless –\n                (a) the general partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter; and\n                (b) the person with whom the general partner is dealing either –\n                        (i) knows that the general partner has no authority; or\n                        (ii) does not know or believe the general partner to be a general partner.\n\n11.

Retiring or deceased partner's share to be a debt\n    Subject to any agreement between the partners, the amount due from surviving or continuing partners to an outgoing partner or the representatives of a deceased partner in respect of the outgoing or deceased partner's share is a debt accruing at the date of the dissolution or death.\n\n49.

Acts preparatory to registration do not constitute partnership\n    Any act done in connection with the making of an application for registration under this Part by or on behalf of persons or partnerships (including external partnerships) proposing to be the partners in a proposed partnership does not of itself create a partnership between those persons or partnerships.\n\n62. Changes in registered particulars\n        (1) If any change occurs in relation to the registered particulars of a limited partnership or incorporated limited partnership, a statement setting out the changed particulars must be lodged with the Director within 7 days after the change occurred.\n        (2) The statement must be signed by all the general partners, or by a general partner authorised by all the general partners for the purposes of this section.\n        (3) In the case of a limited partnership, if the change relates to the admission of a limited partner, or a change in the liability of a limited partner to contribute, the statement must also be signed –\n                (a) by the limited partner concerned; or\n                (b) if that limited partner is a limited partnership, by all the general partners in that limited partnership or by a general partner in that limited partnership authorised by all the general partners in that limited partnership for the purposes of this section.\n        (4) The statement must –\n                (a) be made in the form approved by the Director; and\n                (b) contain the particulars required by the regulations or the approved form of statement; and\n                (c) be accompanied by the prescribed fee.\n        (5) If the statement is duly lodged, the Director is to record the change in the Register, unless, in the case of a limited partnership, as a result of a change in relation to the registered particulars, the partnership is not eligible to be registered as a limited partnership.\n        (6) If subsection (1) is not complied with, each general partner of the limited partnership is guilty of an offence.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 10 penalty units.\n\n63. Register of Limited Partnerships and Incorporated Limited Partnerships\n        (1) The Director is to keep a register of limited partnerships and incorporated limited partnerships registered under this Part (to be called the Register of Limited Partnerships and Incorporated Limited Partnerships).\n        (2) In the Register, there is to be a division of limited partnerships and a division of incorporated limited partnerships.\n        (3) The Register may be kept in such form as the Director thinks fit.\n        (4) The Director must make the information recorded in the Register available for public inspection, on payment of the prescribed fee, at the office of the Director during the ordinary business hours of that office.\n        (5) The Director may correct any error or omission in the Register by –\n                (a) inserting an entry; or\n                (b) amending an entry; or\n                (c) omitting an entry –\n        if the Director decides that the correction is necessary.\n        (6) The Director must not omit an entry in the Register unless satisfied that the whole of the entry was included in error.\n\n64.

Business Names Act 1962 not to apply\n    The Business Names Act 1962 does not apply so as to require the partners in a limited partnership or an incorporated limited partnership to register a business name if that name is the firm-name registered under this Part.\n\nDivision 4 - Limitation of liability of limited partners in limited partnership\n\n66.

Change in liability of limited partner\n        (1) Any reduction in the liability of a limited partner caused by a reduction in the relevant amount shown in the Register in relation to the partner does not extend to any liability of the limited partnership that arose before the reduction is recorded in the Register.\n        (2) Any increase in the liability of a limited partner caused by an increase in the relevant amount shown in the Register in relation to the partner extends to any liability of the limited partnership that arose before the increase is recorded in the Register.\n\n68.
