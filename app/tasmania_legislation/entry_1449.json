What are taxable wages?\n        (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"taxable wages\" are wages that are taxable in this jurisdiction.\n        (2) However, exempt wages are not taxable wages.\n\n11. Wages that are taxable in this jurisdiction\n        (1) For the purposes of this Act, wages are taxable in this jurisdiction if –\n                (a) wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee wholly in this jurisdiction; or\n                (b) wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee in 2 or more Australian jurisdictions, or partly in one or more Australian jurisdictions and partly outside all Australian jurisdictions, and –\n                        (i) the employee is based in this jurisdiction; or\n                        (ii) the employer is based in this jurisdiction (in a case where the employee is not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or\n                        (iii) the wages are paid or payable in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction); or\n                        (iv) the wages are paid or payable for services performed mainly in this jurisdiction (in a case where both the employee and the employer are not based in an Australian jurisdiction and the wages are not paid or payable in an Australian jurisdiction); or\n                (c) the wages are paid or payable by an employer for or in relation to services performed by an employee wholly outside all Australian jurisdictions and are paid or payable in this jurisdiction.\n                Note: Section 66A provides an exemption for wages paid or payable for services performed wholly in one or more other countries for a continuous period of more than 6 months.\n                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                \n            (2) The question of whether wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during the month in which the wages are paid or payable, subject to this section.\n            (3) Any wages paid or payable by an employer in respect of an employee in a particular month are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during that month.\n            Note: For example, if wages paid in a month are paid to an employee for services performed over several months, the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid. The services performed in previous months are disregarded. (The services performed in previous months will be relevant to the question of whether wages paid in those previous months are taxable in this jurisdiction.)\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n            \n                (4) If no services are performed by an employee in respect of an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in relation to the employee –\n                        (a) the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference only to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during the most recent prior month in which the employee performed services in respect of the employer; and\n                        (b) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to the services performed by the employee in respect of the employer during that most recent prior month.\n                (5) If no services were performed by an employee in respect of an employer during the month in which wages are paid or payable to or in relation to the employee or in any prior month –\n                        (a) the wages are taken to be paid or payable for or in relation to services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable; and\n                        (b) the services are taken to have been performed at a place or places where it may be reasonably expected that the services of the employee in respect of the employer will be performed.\n                (6) All amounts of wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same employee are to be aggregated for the purposes of determining whether they are taxable in this jurisdiction (as if they were paid or payable for all services performed by the employee in the month in which the wages are paid or payable, or the most recent prior month, as the case requires).\n                Note: For example, if one amount of wages is paid by an employer in a particular month for services performed in this jurisdiction, and another amount of wages is paid by the same employer in the same month for services performed by the same employee in another Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid are to be aggregated (as if they were paid for all services performed by the employee in that month). Accordingly, subsection (1)(b) would be applied for the purpose of determining whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n                \n                    (7) If wages are paid in a different month from the month in which they are payable, the question of whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction is to be determined by reference to the earlier of the relevant months.\n\n            11A. Jurisdiction in which employee is based\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Act, the jurisdiction in which an employee is based is the jurisdiction in which the employee's principal place of residence is located.\n                    (2) The jurisdiction in which an employee is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable.\n                    (3) If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the jurisdiction in which an employee is based during a month, the jurisdiction in which the employee is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing on the last day of that month.\n                    (4) An employee who does not have a principal place of residence is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an employee who is not based in an Australian jurisdiction.\n                    (5) In the case of wages paid or payable to a corporate employee, the jurisdiction in which the employee is based is to be determined in accordance with section 11B instead of this section (as if a reference in section 11B to an employer were a reference to an employee).\n                    (6) In this section, a \"corporate employee\" is a company that is taken to be an employee under section 34 or 39 or a company to whom a payment is made that is taken to be wages payable to an employee under section 42 or 47 .\n\n            11B. Jurisdiction in which employer is based\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Act, the jurisdiction in which an employer is based is –\n                            (a) the jurisdiction in which the employer's registered business address is located (if the employer has an ABN); or\n                            (b) the jurisdiction in which the employer's principal place of business is located (in any other case).\n                    (2) If wages are paid or payable in connection with a business carried on by an employer under a trust, the employer's registered business address is the registered business address of the trust or, if the trust does not have an ABN, the registered business address of the trustee of the trust.\n                    (3) If an employer has registered business addresses located in different jurisdictions at the same point in time, the jurisdiction in which the employer is based at that point in time is the jurisdiction in which the employer's principal place of business is located.\n                    (4) The jurisdiction in which an employer is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing during the month in which the relevant wages are paid or payable.\n                    (5) If more than one jurisdiction would qualify as the jurisdiction in which an employer is based during a month, the jurisdiction in which the employer is based is to be determined by reference to the state of affairs existing on the last day of that month.\n                    (6) An employer who has neither a registered business address nor a principal place of business is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an employer who is not based in an Australian jurisdiction.\n\n            11C. Place and date of payment of wages\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Act, wages are taken to have been paid at a place if, for the purpose of the payment of those wages –\n                            (a) an instrument is sent or given or an amount is transferred by an employer to a person or a person's agent at that place; or\n                            (b) an instruction is given by an employer for the crediting of an amount to the account of a person or a person's agent at that place.\n                    (2) The wages are taken to have been paid on the date that the instrument was sent or given, the amount was transferred or the account credited in accordance with the instruction (as the case requires).\n                    (3) Wages are taken to be payable at the place at which they are paid, subject to this section.\n                    (4) Wages that are not paid by the end of the month in which they are payable are taken to be payable at –\n                            (a) the place where wages were last paid by the employer to the employee; or\n                            (b) if wages have not previously been paid by the employer to the employee – the place where the employee last performed services in respect of the employer before the wages became payable.\n                    (5) If wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same employee are paid or payable in more than one Australian jurisdiction, the wages paid or payable in that month are taken to be paid or payable in the Australian jurisdiction in which the highest proportion of the wages are paid or payable.\n                    Note: Section 11 requires all wages paid or payable in the same month by the same employer in respect of the same employee to be aggregated for the purpose of determining whether the wages are taxable in this jurisdiction. The above provision ensures only one Australian jurisdiction can be considered to be the jurisdiction in which the wages are paid or payable.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                    \n\n                Division 3 - Other\n\n                12. Payroll tax paid under corresponding applied law\n                        (1) For the purposes of ascertaining the payroll tax payable under this Act by an employer who during a return period pays taxable wages and Commonwealth place wages, there is to be deducted from the amount of payroll tax payable by the employer under this Act the amount of payroll tax payable by the employer under the corresponding applied law.\n                        (2) In this section –\n                            Commonwealth Act means the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Act 1998 of the Commonwealth;\n                            Commonwealth place wages means wages that would be taxable wages within the meaning of the corresponding applied law if the corresponding applied law applied in relation to each place in this jurisdiction that is a Commonwealth place;\n                            corresponding applied law means the provisions of the Payroll Tax Act 2008 that would apply in relation to each place in this jurisdiction that is a Commonwealth place, pursuant to section 6(2) of the Commonwealth Act, if those provisions were \"excluded provisions\" within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Commonwealth Act.\n\n                PART 3 - Wages\n\n                Division 1 - General concept of wages\n\n                13.

Wages include fringe benefits\n                        (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"wages\" include a fringe benefit.\n                        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to benefits that are exempt benefits for the purposes of the FBTA Act (other than deposits to the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account within the meaning of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 of the Commonwealth).\n\n                15. Value of wages comprising fringe benefits\n                        (1) For the purposes of this Act, the value of wages comprising a fringe benefit is to be determined in accordance with the formula –\n                        where –\n                            TV is the value that would be the taxable value of the benefit as a fringe benefit for the purposes of the FBTA Act;\n                            FBT rate is the rate of fringe benefits tax imposed by the FBTA Act that applies when the liability to payroll tax under this Act arises.\n                        (2) In this Act, a reference to taxable wages that were paid or payable by an employer during a month is, in relation to taxable wages comprising fringe benefits –\n                                (a) a reference to the value of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer during the month; or\n                                (b) if an election by the employer is in force under section 16 , a reference to an amount calculated in accordance with that section.\n                        (3) In this Act, a reference to taxable wages that were paid or payable by an employer during a year is, in relation to taxable wages comprising fringe benefits, a reference to an amount calculated by adding together the amounts under subsection (2)(a) or (b) (or subsection (2)(a) and (b) ), as the case requires, for the months of that year.\n\n                16. Employer election regarding taxable value of fringe benefits\n                        (1) An employer who has paid or is liable to pay fringe benefits tax imposed by the FBTA Act in respect of a period of not less than 15 months before 30 June in any year may elect to include as the value of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer during the month concerned –\n                                (a) in a return lodged in relation to each of the first 11 months occurring after 30 June in that year, 1/12 of the amount determined in accordance with subsection (2) or that part of that amount as, in accordance with section 10 , comprises taxable wages for the year of tax (within the meaning of the FBTA Act) ending on 31 March preceding the commencement of the current financial year; and\n                                (b) in the return lodged in relation to the 12th month, the amount determined in accordance with subsection (2) or that part of that amount as, in accordance with section 10 , comprises taxable wages for the year of tax (within the meaning of the FBTA Act) ending on 31 March preceding that month, less the total of the amounts of fringe benefits included in the returns for each of the preceding 11 months.\n                        (2) The amount determined in accordance with this subsection is to be determined in accordance with the formula –\n                        where –\n                            AFBA is the aggregate fringe benefits amount within the meaning of section 136 of the FBTA Act;\n                            FBT rate is the rate of fringe benefits tax imposed by the FBTA Act that applies when the liability to payroll tax under this Act arises.\n                        (3) An election under subsection (1) takes effect when it is notified to the Commissioner in the form approved by the Commissioner.\n                        (4) After an employer has made an election under subsection (1) , the employer must lodge returns containing amounts calculated in accordance with the election unless the Commissioner approves, by notice in writing given to the employer, the termination of the election and allows the employer to include the value referred to in section 15(2)(a) .\n                        (5) If an employer ceases to be liable to pay payroll tax, the value of taxable wages comprising fringe benefits to be included in the employer's final return is (irrespective of whether or not the employer has made an election under subsection (1) ) the value of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer for the period commencing on and including the preceding 1 July until the date on which the employer ceases to be liable to payroll tax, less the value of the fringe benefits paid or payable by the employer during that period on which payroll tax has been paid.\n\n                Division 3 - Superannuation contributions\n\n                17. Wages include superannuation contributions\n                        (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"wages\" include a superannuation contribution.\n                        (2) A \"superannuation contribution\" is a contribution paid or payable by an employer in respect of an employee –\n                                (a) to or as a superannuation fund within the meaning of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 of the Commonwealth; or\n                                (b) as a superannuation guarantee charge within the meaning of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 of the Commonwealth; or\n                                (c) to or as any other form of superannuation, provident or retirement fund or scheme including –\n                                        (i) the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account within the meaning of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 of the Commonwealth; and\n                                        (ii) a retirement savings account within the meaning of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 of the Commonwealth; and\n                                        (iii) a wholly or partly unfunded fund or scheme.\n                        (3) Setting aside any money or anything that is worth money as, or as part of, a superannuation fund, superannuation guarantee charge or any other form of superannuation, provident or retirement fund or scheme is taken to be paying a superannuation contribution.\n                        (4) Making a superannuation contribution of anything that is worth money is taken to be paying a superannuation contribution of the amount equal to its value, and its value is to be worked out in accordance with section 43 as if that section referred to the contribution instead of to wages.\n                        (5) A superannuation, provident or retirement fund or scheme is unfunded to the extent that money paid or payable by an employer in respect of an employee covered by the fund or scheme is not paid or payable during the employee's period of service with the employer.\n                        (6) In this section –\n                            employee includes any person to whom, by virtue of a paragraph of the definition of \"wages\" in section 13(1) , an amount paid or payable in the circumstances referred to in that paragraph constitutes wages.\n\n                Division 4 - Shares and options\n\n                18. Inclusion of grant of shares and options as wages\n                        (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"wages\" include the grant of a share or option to an employee by an employer in respect of services performed by the employee if the share or option is an ESS interest (within the meaning of section 83A-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of the Commonwealth) and is granted to the employee under an employee share scheme (within the meaning of that section).\n                        Note: A grant of a share or an option to an employee by an employer that is not an ESS interest will be taxable as a fringe benefit under Division 2 of this Part.\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n                        \n                            (2) Any such wages are taken, for the purpose of the imposition of payroll tax, to be paid or payable on the relevant day.\n                            (3) For the purposes of this Division, the \"relevant day\" is the day that the employer elects in accordance with this Division to treat as the day on which the wages are paid or payable.\n                            (4) To avoid doubt, the grant of a share or option is valuable consideration for the purposes of section 46 .\n\n                    19. Choice of relevant day\n                            (1) The employer can elect to treat as the \"relevant day\" either the date on which the share or option is granted to the employee or the vesting date.\n                            (2) A share or option is \"granted\" to a person if –\n                                    (a) another person transfers the share or option to that person (other than, in the case of a share, by issuing the share to that person); or\n                                    (b) in the case of a share – another person allots the share to that person; or\n                                    (c) in the case of an option – another person confers the option on, or otherwise creates the option in, that person; or\n                                    (d) the person otherwise acquires a legal interest in the share or option from another person; or\n                                    (e) the person acquires a beneficial interest in the share or option from another person.\n                            (2A) To avoid doubt, if an employee acquires a right to be granted a share or an option, or some other material benefit, at the election of the employer, the share or option is not granted until the employer elects to grant the share or option.\n                            (3) The \"vesting date\" in respect of a share is one of the following dates (whichever happens first):\n                                    (a) the date on which the share vests in the employee (that is, when any conditons applying to the grant of the share have been met and the employee's legal or beneficial interest in the share cannot be rescinded);\n                                    (b) the date at the end of the period of 7 years from the date on which the share is granted to the employee.\n                            (4) The \"vesting date\" in respect of an option is one of the following dates (whichever happens first):\n                                    (a) the date on which the share to which the option relates is granted to the employee;\n                                    (b) the date on which the employee exercises a right under the option to have the share the subject of the option transferred to, allotted to or vested in him or her;\n                                    (c) the date at the end of the period of 7 years from the date on which the option is granted to the employee.\n\n                    20. Deemed choice of relevant day in special cases\n                            (1) If an employer grants a share or an option to an employee and the value of the grant of the share or option is not included in the taxable wages of the employer for the financial year in which the share or option was granted, the employer is taken to have elected to treat the wages constituted by the grant of that share or option as being paid or payable on the vesting date.\n                            (2) If an employer grants a share or an option to an employee and the value of the grant of the share or option is nil or, if the employer were to elect to treat the date of grant as the relevant day, the wages constituted by the grant would not be liable to payroll tax, the employer is taken to have elected to treat the wages constituted by the grant of that share or option as being paid or payable on the date on which the share or option was granted.\n\n                    21. Effect of rescission, cancellation of share or option\n                            (1) If the grant of a share or option is withdrawn, cancelled or exchanged before the vesting date for any valuable consideration (other than the grant of other shares or options), the following provisions apply:\n                                    (a) the date of withdrawal, cancellation or exchange is taken to be the vesting date of the share or option;\n                                    (b) the market value of the share or option, on the vesting date, is taken to be the amount of the valuable consideration (and, accordingly, that amount is the amount paid or payable as wages on that date).\n                            (2) If an employer includes the value of a grant of a share or option in the taxable wages of the employer for a financial year and the grant is rescinded because the conditions attaching to the grant were not met, the taxable wages of the employer, in the financial year in which the grant is rescinded, are to be reduced by the value of the grant as previously included in the taxable wages of the employer.\n                            (3) Subsection (2) does not apply just because an employee fails to exercise an option or to otherwise exercise his or her rights in respect of a share or option.\n\n                    22. Grant of share pursuant to exercise of option\n                        The grant of the share by an employer does not constitute wages for the purposes of this Act if the employer is required to grant the share as a consequence of the exercise of an option by a person and –\n                                (a) the grant of the option to the person constitutes wages for the purposes of this Act; or\n                                (b) the option was granted to the person before 1 July 2008.\n\n                    23. Value of shares and options\n                            (1) If the grant of a share or option constitutes wages under this Division, the amount paid or payable as wages is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be the value of the share or option (expressed in Australian currency) on the relevant day, less the consideration (if any) paid or given by the employee in respect of the share or option (other than consideration in the form of services performed).\n                            (2) The value of a share or an option is –\n                                    (a) the market value; or\n                                    (b) the amount determined as provided for by the Commonwealth income tax provisions.\n                            (3) The employer may elect the method by which the value of a share or an option is determined in any return lodged under this Act.\n                            (4) However, the Commissioner may determine the method by which the value of a share or an option is determined if the grant of the share or option is not included as wages in a return lodged by an employer as required by this Act.\n                            (5) In working out the market value of a share or option, anything that would prevent or restrict conversion of the share or option to money is to be disregarded.\n                            (6) The Commonwealth income tax provisions apply with the following modifications, and any other necessary modifications:\n                                    (a) the value of an option is to be determined as if it were a right to acquire a beneficial interest in a share;\n                                    (b) a reference to the acquisition of a beneficial interest in a share or right is to be read as a reference to the grant of a share or an option.\n                            (7) In this section –\n                                Commonwealth income tax provisions means section 83A-315 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of the Commonwealth and the regulations made for the purpose of that section.\n                                Note: See Division 83A of the Income Tax Assessment Regulations 1997 of the Commonwealth for the relevant regulations\n                                                                                                                                                     \n                                \n\n                        24. Inclusion of shares and options granted to directors as wages\n                                (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"wages\" include the grant of a share or an option by a company to a director of the company who is not an employee of the company by way of remuneration for the appointment or services of the director.\n                                (2) For that purpose, the other provisions of this Division apply in respect of any such grant as if a reference to the employer were a reference to the company and a reference to the employee were a reference to the director of the company.\n                                (3) In this section, a reference to a director of the company includes a reference to the following:\n                                        (a) a person who, under a contract or other arrangement, is to be appointed as a director of the company;\n                                        (b) a former director of the company.\n                                (4) However, if wages referred to in this section are fringe benefits, the value of the wages is to be determined in accordance with Division 2 of this Part (and not this Division).\n                                Note: Section 13 provides that a reference to an employee in this Act includes a reference to any person to whom any amount that is treated as wages under this Act is paid or payable.

Place where wages are payable\n                                    (1) The wages constituted by the grant of the share or option are taken to be paid or payable in this jurisdiction if the share is a share in a local company or, in the case of an option, an option to acquire shares in a local company.\n                                    (2) In any other case, the wages constituted by the grant of the share or option are taken to be paid or payable outside this jurisdiction.\n                                    Note: The place where wages are paid or payable is sometimes relevant to determining whether the wages are liable to payroll tax under this Act.

Corporations A and B form part of a chain of corporations, and corporation B is linked to corporation A. Accordingly, an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A also has an indirect interest in corporation B;\n                                                                        (b) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation C. In this case, corporations A, B and C form part of a chain of corporations. Both corporations B and C are linked to corporation A. The entity that has a direct interest in corporation A has an indirect interest in both corporations B and C;\n                                                                        (c) corporation B also has a direct interest in corporation D. There are now 2 chains of corporations, one consisting of A, B and C, and one consisting of A, B and D. Corporations B, C and D are all linked to corporation A and an entity that has a direct interest in corporation A would have an indirect interest in corporations B, C and D. An entity that has a direct interest in corporation B would have an indirect interest in corporations C and D. However, an entity that has a direct interest in corporation C only would not have an indirect interest in corporation D, as corporation D is not linked to corporation C.\n                                                                (4) The value of the indirect interest of an entity in a corporation (an \"indirectly controlled corporation\") that is linked to a directly controlled corporation is calculated by multiplying together the following:\n                                                                        (a) the value of the direct interest of the entity in the directly controlled corporation;\n                                                                        (b) the value of each direct interest that forms a link in the chain of corporations by which the indirectly controlled corporation is linked to the directly controlled corporation.\n                                                                (5) The following are examples of how subsection (4) works (the examples are cumulative):\n                                                                        (a) an entity has a direct interest (with a value of 80%) in corporation A. Corporation A has a direct interest (with a value of 70%) in corporation B. The value of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation B is 80% × 70% (that is, 56%). Accordingly, in this example the entity has a controlling interest (within the meaning of section 73 (Groups arising from tracing of interests in corporations)) in corporation B;\n                                                                        (b) corporation B also has a direct interest (with a value of 40%) in corporation C. The value of the indirect interest of the entity in corporation C is 80% × 70% × 40% (that is, 22.4%). Accordingly, in this example the entity does not have a controlling interest in corporation C.\n                                                                (6) It is possible for an entity to have more than one indirect interest in a corporation. This may occur if the corporation is linked to more than one corporation in which the entity has a direct interest, or if the corporation is linked to only one corporation in which the entity has a direct interest but is linked through more than one chain of corporations. In that case, the entity has an aggregate interest in the corporation (see section 78 (Aggregation of interests)).\n\n                                                        78.

If later in that financial year the employer ceases to pay wages there will be a further adjustment under this section. The first adjustment will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as a group employer against the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based on the assumption that the period as a group employer is the only period for which the employer paid wages throughout the year). The second adjustment will adjust payroll tax paid for the period as an individual employer against the correct amount of tax that should have been paid (based on the assumption that the period as an individual employer is the only period for which the employer paid wages throughout the year).
