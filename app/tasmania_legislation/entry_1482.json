Summons to executor to prove or renounce, &c.\n    The Court shall continue to have power to summon any person named as executor in any will to prove or renounce probate of the will, and to do such other things concerning the will as have heretofore been customary.\n\n8. When right of executor to prove ceases\n    Where a person appointed executor by a will –\n            (a) survives the testator but dies without having taken out probate of the will;\n            (b) is cited to take out probate of the will and does not appear to the citation; or\n            (c) renounces probate of the will –\n    his rights in respect of the executorship shall wholly cease, and the representation to the testator and the administration of his real and personal estate shall devolve and be committed in like manner as if that person had not been appointed executor.\n\n9. Withdrawal of renunciation\n    Where an executor who has renounced probate has been permitted, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, to withdraw the renunciation and prove the will, the probate shall take effect and be deemed always to have taken effect without prejudice to the previous acts and dealings of, and notices to, any other personal representative who has previously proved the will or taken out letters of administration, and a memorandum of the subsequent probate shall be endorsed on the original probate or letters of administration.\n\n10. Executor of sole or last surviving executor represents original testator\n        (1) An executor of a sole or last surviving executor of a testator is the executor of that testator. This provision shall not apply to an executor who does not prove the will of his testator, and, in case of an executor who on his death leaves surviving him some other executor of his testator who afterwards proves the will of that testator, it shall cease to apply on such probate being granted.\n        (2) So long as the chain of such representation is unbroken, the last executor in the chain is the executor of every preceding testator.\n        (3) The chain of such representation is broken by –\n                (a) an intestacy;\n                (b) the failure of a testator to appoint an executor; or\n                (c) the failure to obtain probate of a will –\n        but is not broken by a temporary grant of administration if probate is subsequently granted.\n        (3A) Where the chain of representation to a testator is broken any beneficiary, or person claiming through a deceased beneficiary, whether at law or in equity, under the will of the testator, may appoint a trust corporation to be executor of the testator, and the acceptance of the appointment constitutes the trust corporation executor of the testator as if the chain of representation had not been broken.\n        (3B) A trust corporation is not under any obligation to accept an appointment under subsection (3A) .\n        (4) Every person in the chain of representation to a testator –\n                (a) has the same rights in respect of the real and personal estate of that testator as the original executor would have had if living; and\n                (b) is, to the extent to which the estate, whether real or personal, of that testator has come to his hands, answerable as if he were an original executor.\n\n11. Right of proving executors to exercise powers\n    Where probate is granted to one or some of two or more persons named as executors, whether or not power is reserved to the other or others to prove, all the powers which are by law conferred on the personal representative may be exercised by the proving executor or executors for the time being and shall be as effectual as if all the persons named as executors had concurred therein.\n\n12. How property to vest between death of person intestate and grant of representation\n    Where a person dies intestate, his real and personal estate, until administration is granted in respect thereof, shall vest in the Chief Justice or in case there may not be a Chief Justice at any time, then in the senior puisne judge, in the same manner and to the same extent as formerly in the case of personal estate it vested in the Ordinary in England.\n\n13. Discretion of Court as to persons to whom administration is to be granted and limitation of grant\n    In granting letters of administration the Court shall have regard to the rights of all persons interested in the real and personal estate of the deceased person, or the proceeds of sale thereof and, in particular, administration with the will annexed may be granted to a devisee or legatee, and any such administration may be limited in any way the Court thinks fit. Provided that –\n            (a) where the deceased died wholly intestate as to his real and personal estate, administration shall, if application is made for that purpose, be granted to some one or more of the persons interested in the residuary estate of the deceased; and\n            (b) if, by reason of the insolvency of the estate of the deceased or of any other special circumstances, it appears to the Court to be necessary or expedient to appoint as administrator some person other than the person who, but for this provision, would by law have been entitled to the grant of administration, the Court may, in its discretion, notwithstanding anything contained in section 14 , appoint as administrator such person as it thinks expedient, and any administration granted under this provision may be limited in any way the Court thinks fit.\n\n13A. Grant of administration to adult\n    The Court may grant letters of administration to a person aged 18 years or more, whether or not the person resides in Tasmania.\n\n14. Provisions as to the number of personal representatives and where minority or life interest\n        (1) Representation shall not be granted to more than 4 persons in respect of the same property; and administration shall, if any beneficiary is an infant, or a life interest arises under a will, be granted either to a trust corporation, with or without an individual, or to not less than two individuals. Provided that the Court in granting administration may act on such prima facie evidence, furnished by the applicant or any other person, as to whether or not there is a minority or life interest, as may be prescribed by the Probate Rules.\n        (2) If there is only one personal representative, not being a trust corporation, then during the minority of the beneficiary or the subsistence of a life interest, and until the estate is fully administered, the Court may, on the application of any person interested or of the guardian, administrator, or receiver of any such person, appoint, in accordance with the Probate Rules, one or more personal representatives in addition to the original personal representative.\n        (3) This section applies to grants of representation made after the commencement of this Act, whether the deceased died before or after such commencement.\n\n15. Power to grant representation of real and personal estate separately or together\n    Representation may be granted in respect of the real estate of a deceased person or any part thereof, and either separately or together with his personal estate, and may also be granted in respect of real estate only where there is no personal estate, or in respect of a trust estate only, and a grant of letters of administration to any real estate may be limited in any way the Court thinks proper. Provided that, where the estate of a deceased person is known to be insolvent, the grant of representation to the real and personal estate shall not be severed except as regards a trust estate.\n\n16. Grant of representation to a trust corporation\n        (1) Where a trust corporation is appointed an executor in a will, either alone or jointly with another person, the Court may grant probate to such corporation, either solely or jointly with another person, as the case may require, and the corporation may act as executor accordingly.\n        (2) Administration may be granted to any trust corporation either solely or jointly with another person, and the corporation may act as administrator accordingly.\n        (3) Representation shall not be granted to a syndic or nominee on behalf of any trust corporation.\n        (4) Any officer authorized for the purpose by any such corporation or by the directors or governing body thereof may swear affidavits, give security, and do any other act or thing which the Court may require on behalf of the trust corporation with a view to the grant of representation to the corporation, and the acts of such officer shall be binding on the corporation, and he shall be entitled to be kept indemnified by the corporation in regard to matters so authorized as aforesaid.\n        (5) Where at the commencement of this Act any interest in real or personal estate is vested in a syndic on behalf of any trust corporation acting as the personal representatives of a deceased person, the same shall, by virtue of this Act, vest in the corporation, and the syndic shall be kept indemnified by the corporation in regard to the interest so vested. This subsection does not apply to securities registered in the name of a syndic, or to land, or to a mortgage or charge of which the syndic is registered proprietor under the Land Titles Act 1980 , but any such securities, land, mortgage, or charge shall be transferred by the syndic to the corporation, or as the corporation may direct.\n        (6) This section has effect whether the deceased died before or after the commencement of this Act; and no such vesting or transfer as aforesaid shall operate as a breach of a covenant or condition against alienation or give rise to a forfeiture.\n\n17. Grant to agent of executor\n    Where any person resident in Tasmania has been, or hereafter may be, appointed to act in the affairs of a testator by an executor not resident in Tasmania, administration of the real and personal estate and effects of such testator, with an exemplification or other authenticated copy of the will or probate annexed, shall be granted to the person so appointed, upon such person giving his own bond to administer without any sureties.\n\n18. Executor not to act while administration is in force\n    Where administration has been granted in respect of any real or personal estate of a deceased person, no person shall have power to bring any action or otherwise act as executor of the deceased person in respect of the estate comprised in or affected by the grant until the grant has been recalled or revoked.\n\n19. Grant of administration pendente lite\n        (1) While any legal proceeding touching the validity of the will of a deceased person, or for obtaining, recalling, or revoking any representation, is pending, the Court may grant administration of the real and personal estate of the deceased to an administrator, who shall have all the rights and powers of a general administrator, other than the right of distributing the residue of the real and personal estate, but shall be subject to the immediate control of the Court and shall act under its direction.\n        (2) The Court may assign to any administrator appointed under this section reasonable remuneration out of the real and personal estate of the deceased or the income thereof.\n\n20. Continuance of legal proceedings after revocation of temporary administration\n    If, while any legal proceeding is pending in any court by or against an administrator to whom a temporary administration has been granted, that administration is revoked, that court may order that the proceeding be continued by or against the new personal representative in like manner as if the same had been originally commenced by or against him, but subject to such conditions and variations, if any, as that court directs.\n\n21. Grant of special administration where personal representative is abroad\n        (1) If, at the expiration of 12 months from the death of a person, any personal representative of the deceased to whom representation has been granted is residing out of the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court may, on the application of any creditor or person interested in the estate of the deceased, grant him special administration in the prescribed form of the real and personal estate of the deceased.\n        (2) The Court may, for the purpose of any legal proceeding to which the administrator under the special administration is a party, order the transfer into Court of any money or securities belonging to the estate of the deceased person, and all persons shall obey any such order.\n        (3) If the personal representative capable of acting as such returns to and resides within the jurisdiction of the Court while any legal proceeding to which a special administrator is a party is pending, such representative shall be made a party to the legal proceeding, and the costs of and incidental to the special administration and such legal proceeding shall be paid by such person and out of such fund as the Court in which the proceeding is pending directs.\n\n22. Administration with will annexed\n    Administration, with the will annexed, shall continue to be granted in every case where such grant has hitherto been customary, and in such case the will of the deceased shall be performed and observed in like manner as if probate thereof has been granted to an executor.\n\n23. Administration during minority of executor\n        (1) Where an infant is appointed or becomes sole executor of a will, administration, with the will annexed, shall be granted to his guardian, or to such other person as the Court thinks fit, until the infant attains the age of 18 years; at which time, and not before, probate of the will may be granted to him.\n        (2) The appointment in a will by a testator of an infant to be an executor shall not operate to transfer any interest in the property of the deceased to the infant, or to constitute him a personal representative for any purpose, unless and until probate is granted to him after he has attained full age.\n\n24. Rights and liabilities of administrator\n    Every person to whom administration of the real and personal estate of a deceased person is granted shall, subject to the limitations contained in the grant, have the same rights and liabilities and be accountable in like manner as if he were the executor of the deceased.\n\n25.\n. . . . . . . .\n\nDivision II - Duties, rights and obligations\n\n26. Duty of personal representative as to inventory\n    The personal representative of a deceased person shall, when lawfully required so to do, exhibit on oath in the Court a true and perfect inventory and account of the real and personal estate of the deceased, and the Court shall have power as heretofore to require personal representatives to bring in inventories.\n\n27. Rights of action by and against personal representatives\n        (1) Subject to the provisions of this section on the death of any person after the commencement of this section all causes of action–\n                (a) subsisting against him shall survive against his estate; and\n                (b) vested in him shall survive for the benefit of his estate.\n        (2) . . . . . . . .\n        (3) Where a cause of action survives under this section for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person, the damages recoverable for the benefit of that estate –\n                (a) shall not include exemplary damages;\n                (b) in the case of a breach of promise to marry, shall be limited to such damage (if any) to that estate as flows from the breach of promise to marry; and\n                (c) where the death of that person has been caused by the act or omission which gives rise to the cause of action –\n                        (i) shall be calculated without reference to any loss or gain to that estate consequent on his death, except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses may be included;\n                        (ii) shall not include damages for pain or suffering, for any bodily or mental harm suffered by him or for the curtailment of his expectation of life;

Proceedings under this Act to be stayed in certain cases\n    If any proceeding in the Court shall be instituted for the administration of the estate of a testator or intestate, the personal representative shall stay all proceedings under this Act from the time he receives notice of such proceeding; but he shall be allowed his costs of any proceedings he may have taken under this Act up to that time.\n\n59. Release to be in force except as to errors or omissions\n    If after such account as aforesaid, or any account of future assets, as hereinafter mentioned, has been filed, it is made to appear that any claim entered therein was erroneously allowed or satisfied, or that any payment entered therein was erroneously made or charged, or that any part of the assets had been omitted in such account, the release to the personal representative hereinbefore mentioned shall nevertheless be and remain in force, save only as respects such error or omission.\n\n60. Rights of claimants against legatees and next-of-kin preserved\n    Nothing contained in this Part shall prejudice or affect any right or remedy which a person having any claim against the estate of a testator or intestate has against any legatee or next-of-kin who has received assets of the testator or intestate; and an executor or administrator having or retaining assets as a legatee or next-of-kin shall be responsible to any such person in the same way as any other legatee or next-of-kin.\n\n61. Further assets to be disposed of and accounted for in same manner as original assets\n    If, after filing such account as provided by this Part, any further assets shall come to the hands, possession, or knowledge of the personal representative, or to the hands or possession of any other person for him, he shall be at liberty to dispose of and account for, and shall be deemed to have duly administered, and shall be released from the same, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as is hereinbefore provided with respect to the original assets; save only that persons of whose claims he has notice at the time of the payment or distribution of such future assets shall have the same rights and remedies as respects those assets which persons of whose claims the executor or administrator had notice at the time of the payment or distribution of the original assets had with respect to such original assets.\n\n62.
