Administrative functions and powers conferred on Commonwealth authorities and officers\n        (1) A relevant State Act does not purport to impose any duty on a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth to perform a function, or to exercise a power, in relation to a matter arising under the relevant State Act if the imposition of the duty would be beyond the legislative power of the Parliament of the State.\n        (2) This section does not limit the operation of section 3 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 .\n\nPART 2 - Validation of invalid administrative actions\n\n6.

Legal effect of invalid administrative actions\n    Every invalid administrative action has, and is deemed always to have had, the same force and effect for all purposes as it would have had if –\n            (a) it had been taken, or purportedly taken, by a State authority or officer of the State; and\n            (b) the relevant function or power had been duly conferred on that officer or authority.\n\n9. Rights and liabilities declared in certain cases\n        (1) Without affecting the generality of section 8 , the rights and liabilities of all persons are, by force of this Act, declared to be, and always to have been, for all purposes the same as if –\n                (a) every invalid administrative action had been taken, or purportedly taken, by a State authority or officer of the State; and\n                (b) the relevant function or power had been duly conferred on that authority or officer.\n        (2) A right or liability conferred or affected by subsection (1) –\n                (a) is exercisable or enforceable; and\n                (b) is to be regarded as always having been exercisable or enforceable –\n        as if it were a right or liability conferred or affected by (or arising from) an administrative action of a State authority or officer of the State on which or whom the relevant function or power had been duly conferred.\n        (3) Any act or thing done or omitted to be done at or before the commencement time in relation to a relevant State Act under or in relation to a right or liability conferred or affected by subsection (1) –\n                (a) has the same effect, and gives rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law; and\n                (b) is to be regarded as always having had the same effect, and given rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law –\n        as if it were done, or omitted to be done, to give effect to, or under the authority of, or in reliance on, an administrative action of a State authority or officer of the State on which or whom the relevant function or power had been duly conferred.\n\n10. This Part to apply to administrative actions as purportedly in force from time to time\n        (1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that this Part operates to give to an invalid administrative action that has subsequently been affected by another action or process no greater effect than it would have had if the administrative action, or any other relevant administrative action, had not been invalid on constitutional grounds (arising from the circumstances referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of invalid administrative action in section 3 ).\n        (2) If administrative action taken by a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth was affected (whether by way of revocation, modification or otherwise) at or before the commencement time in relation to a relevant State Act by any later administrative action or by any judicial process or by any administrative review process, this Part applies to the administrative action as so affected from time to time.\n        (3) In this section, a reference to administrative action taken includes a reference to administrative action purportedly taken, and a reference to administrative action affected in any way includes a reference to administrative action purportedly affected in that way.\n\nPART 3 - Miscellaneous\n\n11.
