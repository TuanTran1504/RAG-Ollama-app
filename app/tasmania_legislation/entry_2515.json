Scope of water management plans\n        (1) A water management plan may be prepared for –\n                (a) a watercourse, several joined watercourses or part of a watercourse, including a water supply channel declared under section 192(1) ; or\n                (b) a lake; or\n                (c) one or more groundwater resources; or\n                (ca) a tidal area that a declaration under section 5A relates to; or\n                (d) any combination of paragraphs (a) , (b) , (c) and (ca) , whether the water resources are joined naturally or artificially –\n        and may include dispersed surface water that normally flows into or replenishes the water resource or water resources in the plan.\n        (2) A water management plan is to include –\n                (a) a statement of the objectives of the plan, including the environmental objectives; and\n                (b) a description of the water regime that best gives effect to the environmental objectives and other relevant objectives of the plan; and\n                (c) an assessment of the ability of that water regime to achieve the environmental objectives and other relevant objectives of the plan; and\n                (d) an assessment of likely detrimental effects of the plan on the quality of water.\n        (3) A water management plan may –\n                (a) provide for the allocation and use of water having regard to the objectives stated under subsection (2)(a) ; and\n                (b) provide for the licensing of all or specified classes of persons taking water from the relevant water resource, including persons who under Part 5 would otherwise have a right to take water without a licence; and\n                (c) provide for the transfer of, and other dealings with, water allocations, including the imposition of conditions under which those transfers or dealings may take place; and\n                (d) . . . . . . . .\n                (e) specify a date on which the plan will take effect; and\n                (f) provide for the administration of the plan by a responsible water entity in accordance with section 38(1) ; and\n                (g) include such other information or material as may be required for the administration of this Act.\n\n15. Effect of plan on water allocation\n    Where a water management plan provides for the allocation and use of water under section 14(3)(a) , the plan must –\n            (a) include an assessment of the capacity of the relevant resource to meet the likely demands for water by existing and future users; and\n            (b) take into account the needs of existing and future users and state the likely effect of the plan on those users, including any effect on businesses carried on by those users.\n\n16. Changes to allocations\n        (1) A water management plan may, in order to improve the management of a water resource, change the basis on which water is allocated from the resource notwithstanding that a consequential variation of a licence to maintain consistency with the plan results in a reduction or increase in a water allocation of the licence.\n        (2) Where a change to the basis of allocating water from a water resource requires a reduction in the water allocations of licences to take water from the resource –\n                (a) the water management plan must provide an equitable procedure for effecting the reduction; and\n                (b) the procedure must give effect to the various sureties attaching to the licences or to the components of water allocations of the licences.\n\n17. Links with other water resources\n        (1) Where the taking, or the taking and use, of water from a water resource has, or is likely to have, a detrimental effect on the quantity or quality of water that is available from another water resource, the water management plan for the first-mentioned resource –\n                (a) must take into account the needs of persons and ecosystems using water from the other resource as well as the needs of persons and ecosystems using water from its own resource; and\n                (b) may, to achieve an equitable balance between competing interests, include provisions designed to prevent or reduce any such detrimental effect.\n        (2) Where the taking or use of water from a water resource affects, or is likely to affect, the management of water in another water resource, the water management plan for the second-mentioned water resource may include provisions relating to the taking or use of water from the first-mentioned water resource.\n\nDivision 2 - Preparation of water management plans\n\n18. Notice of plan\n    As soon as practicable after the Minister determines that a water management plan is to be prepared, the Secretary must –\n            (a) by notice in a local newspaper, notify the public that a water management plan is to be prepared; and\n            (b) prepare a draft water management plan.\n\n19.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n20.

Effect of plan on prior rights\n        (1) In preparing a draft water management plan, the Secretary must ensure that any user of water with a prior right to take water from a water resource to which the plan relates continues to enjoy that right unless it is abrogated as provided by subsection (2) .\n        (2) Where –\n                (a) the total allocations of water available to the holders of prior rights to take water from a water resource to which the plan relates prevent the achievement of the water regime that best gives effect to the environmental objectives referred to in section 14(2)(a) ; or\n                (b) the total allocations of water available to the holders of those rights or the conditions of use attached to those rights may not enable the relevant water resource to be managed consistently with the objectives of this Act –\n            the draft water management plan may provide for the abrogation of any such prior right but only to the extent necessary to ensure that requirements can be met as to –\n                (c) providing the water regime that best gives effect to the environmental objectives referred to in section 14(2)(a) ; and\n                (d) management of the resource consistently with the objectives of this Act.\n        (3) Where a draft water management plan abrogates rights under this section, the Secretary must in accordance with section 24 give notice of the plan to persons holding those rights.\n\n22. Compensation for abrogation of prior right\n        (1) The holder of a prior right that is abrogated under section 21 is entitled to compensation for any liability incurred or loss sustained unless –\n                (a) the abrogation is necessary to ensure that the total quantity of water permitted to be taken from the relevant water resource does not prevent the achievement of the water regime that best gives effect to the environmental objectives referred to in section 14(2)(a) ; or\n                (b) the holder consents to the abrogation or reduction.\n        (2) In default of an agreement between the Minister and the holder of the prior right, the amount of compensation is to be determined in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Act 2011 .\n        (3) For the purposes of this section, any compensation is to be paid out of the Public Account without further or other appropriation than this section.\n        (4) In determining the amount of compensation under subsection (1) , any benefit to the holder of the prior right arising from the abrogation is to be taken into account.\n\n23.
