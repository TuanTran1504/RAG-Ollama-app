Application of Act\n        (1) This Act is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of the State or a participating State that makes provision for the taking of evidence or making of submissions –\n                (a) outside the State or participating State for the purposes of a proceeding in that State; or\n                (b) in the State or participating State for the purposes of a proceeding outside that State.\n        (1A) This Act is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of the State that makes provision for the taking of evidence or making of submissions in the State for the purposes of a proceeding in the State.\n        (2) Unless a contrary intention is shown, nothing in this Act limits or otherwise affects any discretion that a Tasmanian court or a recognised court has with respect to the conduct of a proceeding.\n        (3) This Act extends to any proceeding pending in a Tasmanian court or a recognised court on the commencement of this section.\n        (4) This Act, as amended by the Justice and Related Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2012 , extends to any proceeding pending in a Tasmanian court on the commencement of this subsection.\n\nPART 2 - Use of audio links or audio visual links in proceedings in or before Tasmanian courts\n\n5. Application of Part\n    This Part applies to any proceeding (including a criminal proceeding) in or before a Tasmanian court.\n\n6. Tasmanian courts may take evidence and submissions by audio link or audio visual link\n        (1) A Tasmanian court may, on the application of a party to a proceeding before the court or on its own motion, direct the use, for any purpose, of audio link or audio visual link, from a participating State, from any place outside Australia other than New Zealand, or from any place within Tasmania other than the courtroom or other place at which the court is sitting.\n        (2) The court must not make such a direction if –\n                (a) the necessary facilities are unavailable or cannot reasonably be made available; or\n                (b) the court is satisfied that evidence or submissions can more conveniently be given or made in this State or in the courtroom or other place at which the court is sitting; or\n                (c) the court is satisfied by a party opposing the making of the direction that the direction would be unfair to the party.\n        (3) Where evidence is given from a participating State, the court may exercise in the participating State, in connection with taking evidence or receiving submissions by audio link or audio visual link, any of its powers that the court is permitted, under the law of the participating State, to exercise in the participating State.\n\n7. Giving evidence or making submissions by audio visual link\n    Evidence must not be given, and a submission must not be made, by audio visual link under this Part unless the courtroom or other place where a Tasmanian court is sitting, and the place where the evidence would be given or the submission would be made, are equipped with audio visual link facilities that enable –\n            (a) persons who are at the courtroom or other place to see and hear the person giving the evidence or making the submission; and\n            (b) persons who are at the place where the evidence is given or the submission is made to see and hear persons at the courtroom or other place.\n\n8. Giving evidence or making submissions by audio link\n    Evidence must not be given, and a submission must not be made, by audio link under this Part unless the courtroom or other place where a Tasmanian court is sitting, and the place where the evidence would be given or the submission would be made, are equipped with audio link facilities that enable –\n            (a) persons who are at the courtroom or other place to hear the person giving the evidence or making the submission; and\n            (b) persons who are at the place where the evidence is given or the submission is made to hear persons at the courtroom or other place.\n\n9. Expenses\n    If a Tasmanian court directs evidence to be taken, or submissions to be made, by audio link or audio visual link from a person under this Part, the court may make such orders as it considers just for payment of expenses incurred in connection with taking the evidence or making the submissions or providing the audio link or audio visual link.\n\n10. Counsel entitled to practise\n    A person who is entitled to practise as an Australian legal practitioner in a participating State is entitled to practise as an Australian legal practitioner –\n            (a) in relation to the examination in chief, cross-examination or re-examination of a witness in the participating State whose evidence is being given by audio link or audio visual link in a proceeding before a Tasmanian court; and\n            (b) in relation to the making of submissions by audio link or audio visual link from the participating State in a proceeding before a Tasmanian court.\n\n10A. Failure of audio link or audio visual link\n    If an audio link or audio visual link being used in accordance with this Part for the purposes of a proceeding before a Tasmanian court fails during the proceeding, the court may adjourn the proceeding or make such other orders as are appropriate in the circumstances as if a person present at the place at which the audio link or audio visual link facilities are located were in the presence of the court.\n\n10B. Putting documents to a remote person\n    If in the course of examination of a person by audio link or audio visual link it is necessary to put a document to the person, the Tasmanian court may permit the document to be put to the person –\n            (a) if the document is at the courtroom or other place where the court is sitting, by transmitting by any means a copy of it to the place where the person is giving evidence or making a submission and the copy so transmitted being then put to the person; or\n            (b) if the document is at the place where the person is giving evidence or making a submission, by putting it to the person and then transmitting by any means a copy of it to the courtroom or other place.\n\n10C. Premises to be considered part of court\n        (1) Any place within Tasmania or outside Australia at which audio link or audio visual link facilities are being used for the purpose of a person giving evidence or making a submission in any proceeding is taken to be part of the Tasmanian court that is sitting at a courtroom or other place for the purpose of conducting the proceeding.\n        (2) Subsection (1) has effect, for example, for the purposes of the laws relating to evidence, procedure, contempt of court or perjury.\n        (3) Subsection (1) also has the effect that any offence committed at the place where the person giving the evidence or making the submission is located is to be taken to have been committed at the courtroom or other place where the court is sitting for the purposes of the laws in force in Tasmania.\n\n10D. Administration of oaths and affirmations\n        (1) Subject to subsection (2) , an oath to be sworn or affirmation to be made by a person giving evidence by audio link or audio visual link within Tasmania or outside Australia may be administered either –\n                (a) by means of the audio link or audio visual link, as nearly as practicable in the same way as if the person were to give evidence in the courtroom or other place where the Tasmanian court is sitting; or\n                (b) at the direction of, or on behalf of, the court at the place where the person is giving the evidence by a person authorised by the court.\n        (2) A person giving evidence by audio link or audio visual link from a place outside Australia is not required to give the evidence on oath or affirmation if –\n                (a) the law in force in that country –\n                        (i) does not permit the person to give evidence on oath or affirmation for the purposes of the proceeding; or\n                        (ii) would make it inconvenient for the person to give evidence on oath or affirmation for the purposes of the proceeding; and\n                (b) the Tasmanian court is satisfied that it is appropriate for the evidence to be given otherwise than on oath or affirmation.\n        (3) If evidence is given otherwise than on oath or affirmation, the Tasmanian court is to give the evidence such weight as it thinks fit in the circumstances.\n        (4) Subsections (2) and (3) apply despite anything to the contrary in the Evidence Act 2001 or any other law of this State.\n\nPART 3 - Use of interstate audio links or audio visual links in proceedings in participating State\n\n11.
