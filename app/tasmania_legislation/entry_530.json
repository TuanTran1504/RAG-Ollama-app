Certain transactions concerning leases of commercial property\n            (1) The Commissioner, if satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the circumstances to charge duty on the dutiable value of all the dutiable property in a dutiable transaction, which transaction –\n                    (a) consists of a grant, surrender or transfer of a lease of a commercial property; and\n                    (b) involves goods that are dutiable property in accordance with section 9(1)(j) –\n            may disregard the value of all or any of the goods in determining the dutiable value of the property.\n            (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) , a lease of a commercial property is a lease in respect of real property that is to be used for the purposes of a business, whether or not there are premises on the property that may be used in whole or in part as a residence.\n            (3) The Commissioner may only exercise the discretion referred to in subsection (1) if satisfied that the dutiable transaction was not structured for the purpose of reducing or avoiding the payment of duty.\n\n    25. Partnership interests\n            (1) The dutiable value of a partnership interest is to be determined in accordance with the following formula:\n            where –\n                DV is the dutiable value;\n                A is the value of the partnership interest, or so much of the consideration for the dutiable transaction as relates to the partnership interest, whichever is the greater;\n                X is the unencumbered value of all dutiable property of the partnership;\n                Y is the unencumbered value of all assets of the partnership.\n            (2) If the property of a partnership includes a land-related asset and an interest in the land-related asset is transferred as a result of the transfer of a partnership interest, the unencumbered value of all dutiable property of the partnership (\"X\" in subsection (1) ) is to be reduced by the unencumbered value of the land-related asset, but only if ad valorem duty has been paid or is payable on the transfer of the interest in the land-related asset or if the transfer of the interest in the land-related asset is exempt from duty.\n            (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) , each of the following items of dutiable property is a land-related asset:\n                    (a) land in Tasmania;\n                    (b) a land use entitlement;\n                    (c) an interest in an item of dutiable property referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) .\n\n    26.

What is a relevant acquisition\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person makes a relevant acquisition if the person –\n                            (a) acquires an interest in a landholder –\n                                    (i) that is of itself a significant interest in the landholder; or\n                                    (ii) that, when aggregated with other interests in the landholder held by the person or an associated person, results in an aggregation that amounts to a significant interest in the landholder; or\n                            (b) having a significant interest, or an interest described in paragraph (a)(ii) , in a landholder, acquires a further interest in the landholder.\n                    (2) However, an acquisition of an interest in a private landholder under an arrangement that results in the private landholder ceasing to be a private landholder is not a relevant acquisition because of subsection (1)(a)(ii) .\n                    (3) If a trustee acquires or holds an interest in a landholder and the trustee is a trustee for 2 or more trusts, any interests in the landholder acquired or held by the trustee for different trusts are to be treated as if they were acquired or held independently by separate trustees.\n                    (4) If a person acquires or holds an interest in a landholder otherwise than as a trustee (the personal interest) but also acquires or holds another interest in the landholder as trustee (the trust interest) but is not also a beneficiary under that trust, the personal interest is to be treated as if it were –\n                            (a) acquired or held independently of the trust interest; and\n                            (b) acquired or held by a different person from the person who acquires or holds the trust interest.\n                    (5) If a life company acquires or holds an interest in a landholder, any interests in the landholder acquired or held by the life company for different statutory funds are to be treated as if they were acquired or held independently by separate life companies.\n                    (6) If a life company acquires or holds an interest in a landholder otherwise than for a statutory fund (the first interest) but also acquires or holds another interest in the landholder for a statutory fund (the second interest), the first interest is to be treated as if it were –\n                            (a) acquired or held independently of the second interest; and\n                            (b) acquired or held by a different person from the life company who acquires or holds the second interest.\n                    (7) For the purpose of avoiding doubt, subsections (3) , (4) , (5) and (6) do not affect –\n                            (a) the definition of associated person in section 3 ; or\n                            (b) the operation of subsection (1)(a)(ii) or Part 3 .\n                    (8) In this section –\n                        statutory fund has the same meaning as in section 29 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 of the Commonwealth.\n\n            66. What are interests and significant interests in landholders\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person has an interest in a landholder if the person, in the event of a distribution of all the property of the landholder, would be entitled (otherwise than as a creditor of the landholder or other person to whom the landholder is liable) to any of the property distributed.\n                    (2) A person who has an interest in a landholder has a significant interest in the landholder if the person, in the event of a distribution of all the property of the landholder (disregarding any distribution to meet the liabilities of the landholder) immediately after the interest was acquired, would be entitled (disregarding any entitlement that he or she would have to a distribution of property as a creditor or other person to whom the landholder is liable) to –\n                            (a) in the case of a private landholder, 50% or more of the property distributed; or\n                            (b) in the case of a public landholder, 90% or more of the property distributed.\n\n            67. How an interest may be acquired\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a person acquires an interest in a landholder if the person obtains an interest, or the person's interest increases, in the landholder regardless of how it is obtained or increased.\n                    (2) Without limiting subsection (1) , a person may acquire an interest in a landholder in the following ways:\n                            (a) a purchase, gift or issue of a unit or share;\n                            (b) a cancellation, redemption or surrender of a unit or share;\n                            (c) an abrogation or alteration of a right pertaining to a unit or share;\n                            (d) a payment of an amount owing for a unit or share;\n                            (e) a declaration of trust over units or shares;\n                            (f) a statutory vesting of units or shares;\n                            (g) if the person holds an interest in the landholder (whether or not as trustee for another person) and the capacity in which the person holds the interest changes (including if there is a change in the beneficial ownership of an interest held by a person as trustee).\n                    (3) A person may acquire an interest in a landholder without acquiring units or shares in the landholder.\n\n            68.

How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions – private landholders\n                    (1) If an acquisition statement that discloses a relevant acquisition in a private landholder does not disclose any other acquisitions during the statement period, duty is chargeable, at the rate specified in section 29 on a dutiable transaction, on the amount calculated by multiplying the unencumbered value of all land holdings and goods of the landholder in Tasmania (calculated at the date of acquisition of the interest acquired) by the proportion of that value represented by the interest acquired in the relevant acquisition.\n                    (2) Despite subsection (1) , duty is not chargeable under this section on a relevant acquisition referred to in that subsection if the acquisition is an exempt acquisition.\n                    (3) Despite subsection (1) , duty is not chargeable as specified in that subsection on a relevant acquisition referred to in that subsection if that acquisition is also a concessional acquisition, but is chargeable at the relevant concessional rate of duty under Part 5 of Chapter 2 .\n                    (4) If a relevant acquisition results from the aggregation of the interests of associated persons, the reference in subsection (1) to the interest acquired includes a reference to any interests acquired by associated persons.\n                    (5) If an acquisition statement disclosing a relevant acquisition in a private landholder also discloses one or more other acquisitions during the statement period, duty is chargeable, at the rate specified in section 29 on a dutiable transaction, on the aggregate of the amounts severally calculated, in the manner provided by subsection (1) , in respect of each interest required to be disclosed in the statement.\n                    (6) For the purpose of calculating duty under this section –\n                            (a) if the acquisition statement discloses one or more other acquisitions referred to in subsection (5) and the relevant acquisition is an exempt acquisition, the value of the land and goods for the relevant acquisition is taken to be zero; and\n                            (b) if the acquisition statement discloses one or more other acquisitions and the relevant acquisition is a concessional acquisition –\n                                    (i) the value of the land and goods for the relevant acquisition is taken to be zero; and\n                                    (ii) the relevant concessional amount of duty under Part 5 of Chapter 2 is to be added to the amount of duty otherwise chargeable under this section; and\n                            (c) if any of the other acquisitions referred to in subsection (5) occurred when the landholder did not own land in Tasmania, the value of any goods that the landholder held at the time of that other acquisition is taken to be zero;

Application of Part\n                    (1) This Part applies for the purposes of determining a liability for duty under this Chapter where a person acquires or holds an interest in a landholder as bare trustee for another person.\n                    (2) In this Part, a bare trustee includes a custodian, other than –\n                            (a) a custodian of a trustee of a unit trust scheme in its capacity as a custodian; and\n                            (b) a sub-custodian of a custodian of a trustee of a unit trust scheme in its capacity as a sub-custodian.\n\n            74. Meaning of beneficial owner\n                    (1) If a person who acquires or holds an interest in a landholder acquires or holds that interest as bare trustee for another person, the other person is a beneficial owner of that interest in the landholder.\n                    (2) If a person who is a beneficial owner of an interest in a landholder (whether as a result of subsection (1) or as a result of one or more applications of this subsection) holds that interest as bare trustee for another person, that other person is also a beneficial owner of that interest in the landholder.\n                    (3) For the purposes of this Part, the ultimate beneficial owner of an interest in a landholder is any beneficial owner of the interest in the landholder who does not hold that interest as bare trustee for another person.\n\n            75. Beneficial owners liable for duty on acquisition in landholders\n                    (1) Any interest in a landholder that is acquired or held by a person (the legal owner) as bare trustee for another person is taken, for the purposes of this Chapter, to have been acquired by, or to be held by, the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest in the landholder, rather than the legal owner.\n                    (2) Accordingly, the ultimate beneficial owner of an interest acquired by the legal owner will be liable to lodge an acquisition statement, and to pay any duty chargeable under this Chapter, in respect of any relevant acquisition made as a result of that acquisition by the legal owner.\n                    (3) For the purpose of determining whether an acquisition is a relevant acquisition, section 65 applies as if a reference to a person who acquires or holds an interest in a landholder were a reference to the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest, rather than the legal owner.\n                    (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) , the acquisition is to be aggregated with other interests held by the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest and any associated person of the ultimate beneficial owner of the interest.\n\n            PART 3A - General Principles to be Applied under this Chapter\n\n            76.

Constructive ownership of land holdings and other property: discretionary trusts\n                    (1) A person, or a person of a class of persons, in the favour of whom or which, by the terms of a discretionary trust, capital which is the subject of the trust may be applied –\n                            (a) in the event of the exercise of a power or discretion in favour of the person or class; or\n                            (b) in the event that a discretion conferred under the trust is not exercised –\n                    is, for the purposes of this section, a beneficiary of the trust.\n                    (2) A beneficiary of a discretionary trust is taken to own or be otherwise entitled to all of the property which is the subject of the trust unless the Commissioner determines otherwise.\n                    (3) For the purposes of this Chapter, any property that is the subject of a discretionary trust is taken to be the subject of any other discretionary trust –\n                            (a) that is; or\n                            (b) any trustee of which (in the capacity of trustee) is –\n                    a beneficiary of it.\n                    (4) Subsection (3) extends to apply to property that is the subject of a discretionary trust only by the operation of that subsection.\n\n            78. Inclusion of land holdings and goods recently transferred\n                    (1) In determining the land holdings or goods of a private unit trust scheme or private company, the land holdings or goods of the scheme or company are taken to include any land holdings or goods of the unit trust scheme or company, or of a linked entity of the scheme or company, that were recently transferred –\n                            (a) to the person who has made the acquisition in the scheme or company; or\n                            (b) to a person who was an associated person of the person referred to in paragraph (a) when the acquisition occurred and also was an associated person of the person referred to in paragraph (a) when the transfer of the land holding or goods occurred.\n                    (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) , a land holding or goods are recently transferred if the land holding or goods are transferred within 12 months before the acquisition is made.\n                    (3) Subsection (1) does not apply if, after considering the circumstances of the acquisition, the Commissioner determines that it is just and reasonable in the circumstances that the subsection should not apply.\n                    (4) The duty payable under this Chapter in respect of the acquisition is to be reduced by the amount of ad valorem duty (if any) paid in respect of the transfer under Chapter 2 of the land holding or goods referred to in subsection (1) .\n                    (5) In this section, a reference to a transfer, in relation to a land holding or goods, includes a reference to any dutiable transaction that effects a change in the beneficial ownership of the land holding or goods in favour of the person referred to in subsection (1)(a) or (b) .\n\n            79. Agreements for sale or transfer of land\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, the transferor and the transferee under an uncompleted agreement for the sale or transfer of land or of goods, or of both land and goods, are taken to be separately entitled to the whole of that land or those goods, or of that land and those goods.\n                    (2) If duty is charged on an acquisition that relates to a land holding, or a land holding and goods, to which subsection (1) applies, the Commissioner may defer all or part of the payment of duty under section 59 of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 .\n                    (3) If –\n                            (a) at the time of acquisition of an interest by a person in a landholder that necessitates the lodgement of an acquisition statement under this Chapter, the landholder was the transferor under an uncompleted agreement for the sale or transfer of land or of goods, or of both land and goods; and\n                            (b) the person acquiring that interest in the landholder, or an associated person of that person, is not also the transferee of the sale or transfer of land or of goods, or of both land and goods, under that agreement; and\n                            (c) that agreement is subsequently completed –\n                    the Commissioner is to assess or reassess the statement as though the land or goods, or land and goods, which are the subject of the agreement were not, at the time of the acquisition concerned, a land holding or goods, or a land holding and goods, of the landholder.\n                    (4) If the statement is reassessed under subsection (3) , any amount paid in excess of the amount reassessed is to be refunded.\n                    (5) If –\n                            (a) at the time of acquisition of an interest by any person in a landholder that necessitates the lodgement of an acquisition statement under this Chapter, the landholder was the transferee under an uncompleted agreement for the sale or transfer of land or of goods, or of both land and goods; and\n                            (b) the agreement is subsequently rescinded, annulled or otherwise terminated without completion –\n                    the Commissioner is to assess or reassess the statement as though the land or goods, or land and goods, which are the subject of the agreement were not, at the time of the acquisition concerned, a land holding or goods, or a land holding and goods, of the landholder.\n                    (6) If the statement is reassessed under subsection (5) , any amount paid in excess of the amount reassessed is to be refunded.\n                    (7) In this section, a reference to a landholder includes a reference to a linked entity of the landholder.\n\n            80. Agreements for sale or issue of shares or units in landholder\n                    (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, if an agreement is made to purchase or issue a unit or share in a landholder, then, on and from the agreement liability date –\n                            (a) the purchaser or person to whom the unit or share is to be issued is taken to have an entitlement to a distribution of property of the landholder in the event of a distribution of all the property of the landholder (as if the purchase or interest acquired by the person were registered on the agreement liability date); and\n                            (b) in the case of an agreement to purchase a share or unit, the registered interest of the vendor in the unit or share is to be disregarded; and\n                            (c) the purchaser or person to whom a share or unit is to be issued, under an agreement for the sale or issue of a share or unit in a landholder, acquires an interest in the landholder on the agreement liability date.\n                    (2) In subsection (1) –\n                        agreement liability date means the date on which the first of the following occurs:\n                                (a) the agreement is completed;\n                                (b) the necessary transfer or title documents are delivered to the person acquiring the share or unit;\n                                (c) the consideration for the purchase or issue is paid.\n                    (3) This section does not apply in respect of shares or units in a public landholder.\n\n            81. Valuation of property\n                    (1) Subject to this Chapter, the provisions of this Act for ascertaining the value of transfers of dutiable property chargeable with ad valorem duty extend to an acquisition statement under this Chapter and the unencumbered value of land holdings and goods mentioned in it.\n                    (2) In determining the unencumbered value of land holdings or goods under this Chapter, any arrangement made in respect of the land holdings or goods that has the effect of reducing the unencumbered value is to be disregarded, subject to subsection (3) .\n                    (3) An arrangement is not to be disregarded if the Commissioner is satisfied that the arrangement was not made as part of an arrangement or scheme with a collateral purpose of reducing the duty otherwise payable in relation to the relevant acquisition.\n                    (4) In considering whether or not he or she is satisfied for the purposes of subsection (3) , the Commissioner may have regard to –\n                            (a) the duration of the arrangement before the relevant acquisition; and\n                            (b) whether the arrangement has been made with an associated person; and\n                            (c) whether there is any commercial efficacy to the making of the arrangement other than to reduce duty; and\n                            (d) any other matters the Commissioner considers relevant.\n\n            82. Maximisation of entitlements on distribution of property\n                    (1) This section applies to any calculation, for the purposes of this Chapter, of the entitlement of a person (the interested person) to participate in a distribution of the property of a landholder.\n                    (2) A calculation is to be made based, firstly, on a distribution carried out in accordance with the constitution of the landholder, and with any law relevant to the distribution, as in force at the time of distribution, and the entitlement of the interested person is to be evaluated accordingly.\n                    (3) Next, a calculation is to be made as if a distribution had been carried out after the interested person, and any other person whom the interested person has power to direct with respect to such a distribution or who is, in relation to the interested person, an associated person, had exercised all powers and discretions exercisable by them by reason of having acquired an interest in the landholder concerned –\n                            (a) to effect or compel an alteration to the constitution of the landholder; and\n                            (b) to vary the rights conferred by units or shares in the landholder; and\n                            (c) to effect or compel the substitution or replacement of units or shares in the landholder with other units or shares in it –\n                    in such a manner as would maximise the value of the entitlement, and the entitlement of the interested person is to be evaluated accordingly.\n                    (4) The results obtained by the evaluations of the interested person's entitlement in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) are then to be compared, and whichever evaluation results in a greater entitlement is the evaluation of the entitlement to be used for the purposes of this Chapter unless the Commissioner, being satisfied that the application of this subsection in the particular case would be inequitable, determines that the evaluation that results in the lesser entitlement is the evaluation to be so used.\n                    (5) The evaluation in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) that results in the lesser entitlement is to be used for the purposes of this Chapter if the Commissioner so determines under subsection (4) .\n\n            PART 3B - Exemptions, Concessions and Refunds\n\n            83.
