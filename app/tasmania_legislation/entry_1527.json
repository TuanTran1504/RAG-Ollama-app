Application to Court to validate dispositions to interested witnesses\n        (1) Where, but for the operation of section 12 , a person would be entitled to a beneficial disposition, that person may, subject to and in accordance with the Rules, apply to the Court for an order that that person is to be entitled under the will as if that section did not apply in relation to him or her.\n        (2) An application under this section may be made before the grant of probate of the will but, subject to subsection (3) , is not to be made more than 6 months after that date.\n        (3) The Court may extend the time for the making of an application under this section, whether or not the time appointed under subsection (2) has expired, but no application may be made after the final distribution of the estate and no order under this section affects the distribution of any part of the estate made before the making of the application.\n\n14. Declaration by Court as to non-application of section 12\n        (1) Where the Court is satisfied that the entitlement of the applicant under the will was known to and approved by the testator and was not included in the will as the result of fraud, duress or the exercise of undue influence by any person, the Court may, by order, declare that section 12 does not apply in relation to the applicant in respect of the will in respect of which the application was made.\n        (2) On a copy of an order under subsection (1) being served on the personal representative of the testator, the will of the testator has effect as if section 12 does not apply in relation to the applicant in respect of the will of the testator.\n        (3) In an application under section 13 , the applicant is not entitled to rely on any evidentiary presumption to prove or assist in proving that the testator knew and approved the contents of the will.\n\nDivision 3 - Revocation, alteration and revival of wills\n\n15.

Tribunal may make certain orders\n        (1) The Tribunal may, in accordance with this Division, make orders authorising the making of a will in specific terms approved by the Tribunal on behalf of a person who lacks testamentary capacity.\n        (2) For the purposes of this Division, a person does not lack testamentary capacity by reason only of the fact that he or she is a minor, but does lack testamentary capacity if he or she is a minor and lacks testamentary capacity by reason of disability or injury.\n        (3) The powers of the Tribunal under subsection (1) may be exercised –\n                (a) on the application of any person; or\n                (b) of its own motion –\n        but the Tribunal must first hold a hearing in accordance with the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020 .\n        (4) The Tribunal may not make an order under subsection (1) unless it is satisfied, after making such enquiries as it considers reasonable, that the person has not made a will or any purported will.\n        (5) The Tribunal may authorise the making of a will that deals with the whole or part of the property of the person.\n        (6) The Tribunal is not to make an order under this Division unless the person on whose behalf authorisation for the making of the will is sought is alive when the order is made.\n        (7) The Tribunal may at any time direct that a matter before the Tribunal pursuant to this Division proceed by way of an application to the Court under Division 2 .\n\n31. Validity of statutory wills made by Tribunal\n    A statutory will made by the Tribunal is invalid if there exists a prior will, which is not a statutory will made by the Tribunal or the Guardianship and Administration Board formerly established under the Guardianship and Administration Act 1995 , of the person for whom it is made.\n\n32. Application for a statutory will\n        (1) In applying to the Tribunal for a statutory will under this Division, the applicant must, subject to the Tribunals discretion, provide to the Tribunal –\n                (a) a written statement of the general nature of the application and the reasons for making it, including the grounds on which it is alleged that the person for whom the will is proposed to be made lacks testamentary capacity; and\n                (b) an estimate, so far as the applicant is aware of it, of the size and character of the estate of the proposed testator; and\n                (c) a proposal nominating the persons who should benefit under the proposed will and the extent to which each person nominated should share in the estate; and\n                (d) any evidence, so far as it is available, relating to the wishes of the proposed testator; and\n                (e) evidence of the likelihood of the proposed testator acquiring or regaining capacity to make a will at any future time; and\n                (f) a statutory declaration stating that it is the applicant's belief that the proposed testator has not made a will or any purported will and setting out the reasons for that belief; and\n                (g) any evidence of the interests, so far as they are known to the applicant, or can be discovered with reasonable diligence, of any person who would be entitled to receive any part of the estate of the proposed testator if the proposed testator were to die intestate; and\n                (h) any evidence of any facts indicating the likelihood, so far as they are known to the applicant, or can be discovered with reasonable diligence, of an application being made under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act 1912 ; and\n                (i) any evidence of the circumstances, so far as they are known to the applicant, or can be discovered with reasonable diligence, of any person for whom the proposed testator might reasonably be expected to make provision under a will; and\n                (j) a reference to any disposition for a body, whether charitable or not, or for a charitable purpose that the proposed testator might reasonably be expected to give or make by will; and\n                (k) any other facts that the applicant considers to be relevant to the application.\n        (2) An application under subsection (1) is to be lodged with the Registrar, within the meaning of the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020 .\n\n33. Tribunal must be satisfied of certain matters\n    The Tribunal must not make an order authorising the making of a will for a proposed testator unless it is satisfied –\n            (a) if there is an applicant, that the applicant is an appropriate person to make the application; and\n            (b) that there is reason to believe that the proposed testator is incapable of making a will; and\n            (c) following such enquiries as are reasonable, that the proposed testator has not made a will or any purported will; and\n            (d) that adequate steps have been taken to allow representation of all persons with a legitimate interest in the application, including persons who have reason to expect a disposition or benefit from the estate of the proposed testator; and\n            (e) that it is appropriate to make an order for the execution of a will for a proposed testator; and\n            (f) that the proposed will, alteration of revocation is or is reasonably likely to be one that would have been made by the proposed testator if he or she had had testamentary capacity.\n\n34.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n35. Execution of a will made under this Division\n    If the Tribunal makes an order authorising the making of a will for any person, a will executed under that order is to be –\n            (a) signed by the President or Deputy President of the Tribunal in the presence of 2 or more witnesses present at the same time; and\n            (b) attested and subscribed by those witnesses in the presence of the President or Deputy President.\n\n36. Alteration of statutory will made by Tribunal\n    The Tribunal may alter a statutory will made by the Tribunal, or by the Guardianship and Administration Board formerly established under the Guardianship and Administration Act 1995 , on application by a person in accordance with this Division as if references to the procedure for making a statutory will were read as references to the procedure for alteration of a statutory will.\n\n37. Revocation of statutory will made by Tribunal\n        (1) The Tribunal may revoke a statutory will made by the Tribunal, or by the Guardianship and Administration Board formerly established under the Guardianship and Administration Act 1995 , on application by a person in accordance with this Division as if references to the procedure for making a statutory will were read as references to the procedure for revocation of a statutory will.\n        (2) A person who acquires or regains capacity to make a will after a statutory will has been made on his or her behalf may revoke the statutory will in the same manner as a will may be revoked under Division 3 of Part 2 .\n\n38. Statutory will made by Tribunal to be forwarded to executor\n    On the execution of a statutory will, the Tribunal must forward –\n            (a) the will to the executor named in the will or, if the executor is not the Public Trustee or a Trustee Company within the meaning of the Trustee Companies Act 1953 , to a law practice nominated by the executor; and\n            (b) a copy of the will to the proposed testator.\n\nDivision 4 - Statutory wills generally\n\n39. Effect of statutory will\n    A statutory will has the same effect for all purposes as if –\n            (a) the person for whom it is made were capable of making a will; and\n            (b) the statutory will had been executed by him or her in the manner required by Division 2 of Part 2 .\n\n40. Recognition of statutory wills\n    A statutory will made according to the law of the place where the deceased was resident at the time of execution is to be regarded as a valid will of the deceased.\n\n41. Application of common law and equity to statutory wills\n    The principles and rules of the common law and of equity are, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this Part, to apply to a valid statutory will in the same way as they apply to a will executed in accordance with Division 2 of Part 2 .\n\nDivision 5 - Rectification of wills by Court\n\n42. Court may rectify a will\n        (1) The Court may make an order to rectify a will to carry out the intentions of the testator if the Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the will does not carry out the testator's intentions because –\n                (a) a clerical error was made; or\n                (b) the will does not give effect to the testator's instructions.\n        (2) A person who wishes to make an application for an order under this section must apply to the Court within 3 months after the date of the death of the testator.\n        (3) The Court may extend the period of time for making the application if the Court thinks this is necessary, even if the original period of time has expired, but not if the final distribution of the estate has been made.\n        (4) A personal representative who makes a distribution to a beneficiary is not liable if –\n                (a) the distribution is made under section 64 ; or\n                (b) the distribution is made –\n                        (i) at a time when the personal representative was not aware of any application for rectification or any application having been made under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act 1912 ; and\n                        (ii) at least 3 months after the death of the testator.\n        (5) The Court may direct that a certified copy of an order made under this section be attached to a will to which it applies and must, if it so directs, retain the will until the copy of the order is attached.\n\nPART 4 - Construction of Wills\n\n43. What interest in property does a will dispose of?\n    If –\n            (a) a testator has made a will disposing of property; and\n            (b) after the making of the will and before his or her death, the testator disposes of an interest in that property –\n    the will operates to dispose of any remaining interest the testator has in that property.\n\n44. When a will takes effect\n        (1) A will takes effect, with respect to the property disposed of by the will, as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator.\n        (2) This section does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will.\n\n45. Effect of failure of disposition\n        (1) To the extent that any disposition of property in a will, other than the exercise of a power of appointment, is ineffective wholly or in part, the will takes effect as if the property or the undisposed part of the property were part of the residuary estate of the testator.\n        (2) This section does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will.\n\n46. Use of extrinsic evidence to clarify a will\n        (1) In proceedings to construe a will, evidence, including evidence of the testator's intention, is admissible to the extent that the language used in the will renders the will, or any part of the will –\n                (a) meaningless; or\n                (b) ambiguous on the face of the will; or\n                (c) ambiguous in the light of the surrounding circumstances.\n        (2) Evidence of a testator's intention is not admissible to establish any of the circumstances referred to in subsection (1)(c) .\n        (3) Nothing in this section prevents evidence that is otherwise admissible at law from being admissible in proceedings to construe a will.\n\n47. Effect of change in testator's domicile\n    The construction of a will is not altered because of any change in the testator's domicile after executing the will.\n\n48. Income on contingent, future or deferred dispositions\n    A contingent, future or deferred disposition of property, whether specific or residuary, in a will includes any intermediate income of the property that has not been disposed of by the will.\n\n49. Beneficiaries must survive testator for 30 days\n        (1) If a disposition is made in a will to a person who dies within 30 days after the death of the testator, the will is to take effect as if the person had died immediately before the testator.\n        (2) This section does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will.\n        (3) A general requirement or condition that a beneficiary survive the testator does not indicate a contrary intention for the purpose of this section.\n\n50. What does general disposition of property include?\n    A general disposition in a will of all or the residue of the testator's property, or of all or the residue of his or her property of a particular description, includes all the property of the relevant description over which he or she has a general power of appointment exercisable by will and operates as an exercise of the power.\n\n51. What does general disposition of land include?\n    A general disposition, in a will, of land or of land in a particular area includes leasehold land whether or not the testator owns freehold land.\n\n52. Effect of devise of real property without words of limitation\n        (1) A disposition of real property, in a will, to a person without words of limitation is to be construed as passing the whole estate or interest of the testator in that property to that person.\n        (2) Where –\n                (a) any real estate is devised to a trustee, without any express limitation of the estate to be taken by the trustee; and\n                (b) the beneficial interest in that real estate, or in the surplus rents and profits of that real estate, is not given to a person for life, or that beneficial interest is given to a person for life, but the purposes of the trust may continue beyond the life of that person –\n        that devise is to be construed to vest in that trustee the whole legal estate (whether the fee simple or any other estate) which the testator had power to dispose of by will in that real estate, and not an estate determinable when the purposes of the trust are satisfied.\n\n53. How dispositions to issue operate\n        (1) A disposition to a person's issue without limitation as to remoteness must be distributed to that person's issue in the same way as that person's estate would be distributed if that person had died intestate leaving only issue surviving.\n        (2) This section does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will.\n\n54. How requirements to survive with issue are construed\n        (1) If there is a disposition to a person in a will that is expressed to fail if there is either –\n                (a) a want or a failure of issue of that person either in his or her lifetime or at his or her death; or\n                (b) an indefinite failure of issue of that person –\n        those words must be construed to mean a want or failure of issue in the person's lifetime or at the person's death and not an indefinite failure of his or her issue.\n        (2) This section does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will except where the result would be to cause a failure of the disposition.\n\n55. Dispositions not to fail because issue have died before testator\n        (1) This section applies if –\n                (a) a testator makes a disposition of property to a person, whether as an individual or as a member of a class, who is issue of the testator (in this section referred to as an original beneficiary); and\n                (b) under the will, the interest of the original beneficiary in the property does not come to an end at or before the original beneficiary's death; and\n                (c) the disposition is not a disposition of property to the testator's issue, without limitation as to remoteness; and\n                (d) the original beneficiary does not survive the testator for 30 days.\n        (2) The issue of the original beneficiary who survive the testator for 30 days take the original beneficiary's share of the property in place of the original beneficiary as if the original beneficiary had died intestate leaving only issue surviving.\n        (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if –\n                (a) the original beneficiary did not fulfil a condition imposed on the original beneficiary in the will; or\n                (b) a contrary intention appears in the will.\n        (4) A general requirement or condition that issue survive the testator or reach a specified age does not show a contrary intention for the purposes of subsection (3)(b) .\n        (5) A disposition of property to issue as joint tenants does not, of itself, show a contrary intention for the purposes of subsection (3)(b) .\n\n56. Construction of dispositions\n        (1) A disposition of the residue of the estate of a testator, or of the whole of the estate of a testator, that refers only to the real estate of the testator, or only to the personal estate of the testator, is to be construed to include both the real and personal estate of the testator.\n        (2) If any part of a disposition in fractional parts of the whole or of the residue of the estate of a testator fails, the part that fails passes to the part that does not fail, and, if there is more than one part that does not fail, to all those parts proportionately.\n        (3) This section does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will.\n\n57. Legacies to unincorporated associations of persons\n        (1) A disposition –\n                (a) to an unincorporated association of persons that is not a charity; or\n                (b) to or on trust for the aims, objects or purposes of an unincorporated association of persons that is not a charity; or\n                (c) to or on trust for the present and future members of an unincorporated association of persons that is not a charity –\n        has effect as a legacy or devise in augmentation of the general funds of the association.\n        (2) Property that is, or that is to be taken to be, a disposition in augmentation of the general funds of an unincorporated association must be –\n                (a) paid in the general fund of the association; or\n                (b) transferred to the association; or\n                (c) sold or otherwise disposed of on behalf of the association and the proceeds paid into the general fund of the association.\n        (3) If the personal representative pays money to an association under a disposition, the receipt of the Treasurer or a like officer, if the officer is not so named, of the association is an absolute discharge for that payment.\n        (4) If the personal representative transfers property to an association under a disposition, the transfer of that property to a person or persons designated in writing by any 2 persons holding the offices of President, Chairperson, Treasurer or Secretary or like officers, if those officers are not so named, is an absolute discharge to the personal representative for the transfer of that property.\n        (5) Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will.\n        (6) It is not an objection to the validity of a disposition to an unincorporated association of persons that a list of persons who were members of the association at the time the testator died cannot be compiled, or that the members of the association have no power to divide assets of the association beneficially among themselves.\n\n58. Can a person, by a will, delegate the power to dispose of property?\n    A power or a trust to dispose of property, created by a will, is not void on the ground that it is a delegation of the testator's power to make a will, if the same power or trust would be valid if made by the testator by instrument during his or her lifetime.\n\n59. Effect of referring to valuation in a will\n        (1) Except to the extent that a method of valuation is at the relevant time required under a law of Tasmania or any other place, or is provided for in the will, an express or implied requirement in a will that a valuation of property be made or accepted for any purpose is to be construed as if it were a reference to a valuation of the property as at the date of the testator's death made by a competent valuer.\n        (2) This section does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the will.\n\nPART 5 - Wills under Foreign Law\n\n59A. Part does not limit operation of Part 5A\n    This Part does not limit the operation of Part 5A .\n\n60. General rule as to formal validity\n        (1) A will is taken to be properly executed if its execution conforms to the internal law in force in the place –\n                (a) where it was executed; or\n                (b) that was the testator's domicile or habitual residence, either at the time the will was executed, or at the testator's death; or\n                (c) of which the testator was a national, either at the date of execution of the will, or at the testator's death.\n        (2) The following wills are also taken to be properly executed:\n                (a) a will executed on board a vessel or aircraft, if the will has been executed in conformity with the internal law in force in the place with which the vessel or aircraft may be taken to have been most closely connected having regard to its registration and other relevant circumstances;\n                (b) a will, so far as it disposes of immovable property, if it has been executed in conformity with the internal law in force in the place where the property is situated;\n                (c) a will, so far as it revokes a will or a provision of a will that has been executed in accordance with this Act, or that is taken to have been properly executed by this Act, if the later will has been executed in conformity with any law by which the earlier will or provision would be taken to have been validly executed;\n                (d) a will, so far as it exercises a power of appointment, if the will has been executed in conformity with the law governing the essential validity of the power.\n        (3) A will to which this section applies, so far as it exercises a power of appointment, is not taken to have been improperly executed because it has not been executed in accordance with the formalities required by the instrument creating the power.\n\n61. Ascertainment of system of internal law\n    If the internal law in force in a place is to be applied to a will, but there is more than one system of internal law in force in the place that relates to the formal validity of wills, the system to be applied is determined as follows:\n            (a) if there is a rule in force throughout the place that indicates which system of internal law applies to the will, that rule must be followed;\n            (b) if there is no rule, the system of internal law is that with which the testator was most closely connected either –\n                    (i) at the time of his or her death, if the matter is to be determined by reference to circumstances prevailing at his or her death; or\n                    (ii) in any other case, at the time of execution of the will.\n\n62. Construction of law applying to wills under foreign law\n        (1) In determining whether a will has been executed in conformity with a particular law, regard must be had to the formal requirements of that law at the time of execution, but account may be taken of a later alteration of the law affecting wills executed at that time, if the alteration enables the will to be treated as properly executed.\n        (2) If a law in force outside Tasmania is applied to a will, a requirement of that law that special formalities must be observed by testators of a particular description, or that the witnesses to the execution of a will must have certain qualifications, is to be taken to be a formal requirement only, despite any rule of that law to the contrary.\n\nPART 5A - International Wills\n\n62A. Interpretation\n    In this Part –\n        Convention means the Convention providing a Uniform Law on the Form of an International Will 1973 signed in Washington, D.C. on 26 October 1973;\n        international will means a will made in accordance with the requirements of the Annex to the Convention as set out in Schedule 5 .\n\n62B. Application of Convention\n    The Annex to the Convention has the force of law in this jurisdiction.\n\n            Note\n        The Annex to the Convention is set out in Schedule 5 .\n\n62C. Persons authorised to act in connection with international wills\n        (1) For the purposes of this Part, the following persons are authorised to act in connection with an international will:\n                (a) an Australian legal practitioner;\n                (b) a public notary of any Australian jurisdiction.\n        (2) For the purposes of this Part, a reference in the Annex to the Convention to a person authorised to act in connection with international wills is a reference to –\n                (a) a person referred to in subsection (1) who is acting in Australia; or\n                (b) any other person who is acting as an authorised person under the law of a state (other than Australia) that is a party to the Convention.\n\n                Note\n            This section gives effect to Articles II and III of the Convention.\n\n62D. Witnesses to international wills\n    The conditions requisite to acting as a witness to an international will are governed by the law of this jurisdiction.\n\n            Note\n        For the relevant provisions of this Act, see Division 2 of Part 2 .\n\n62E. Application of Act to international wills\n    To avoid doubt, the provisions of this Act that apply to wills extend to international wills.\n\nPART 6 - Miscellaneous\n\n63. Persons entitled to see will\n        (1) Any person having the possession or control of a will (including a revoked will) or a copy of any such will and any part of such a will (including a purported will) of a deceased person must allow any or all of the following persons to inspect and, at their own expense, take copies of it:\n                (a) any person named or referred to in it, whether as beneficiary or not;\n                (b) the surviving spouse, any parent or guardian and any issue of the testator;\n                (c) any person who would be entitled to a share of the estate of the testator if the testator had died intestate;\n                (d) any creditor or other person having any claim at law or in equity against the estate of the deceased;\n                (e) any beneficiaries of prior wills of the deceased;\n                (f) a parent or guardian of a minor referred to in the will or who would be entitled to a share of the estate of the testator if the testator had died intestate.\n        (2) Any person having the possession or control of a will (including a revoked will) or a copy of any such will and any part of such a will (including a purported will), of a deceased person must produce it in Court if required to do so.\n        (3) Nothing in this section authorises the inspection or production of a will, a revoked will, a copy of any such will or any part of such a will while the testator is alive.\n        (4) Nothing in this section limits the rights of a person under any other law.\n\n64.
