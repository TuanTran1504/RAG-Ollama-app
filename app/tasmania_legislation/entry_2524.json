Application\n                (1) Subject to subclause (3) , these rules apply to a civil proceeding commenced in the Court on or after the commencement date.\n                (2) Subject to this Schedule, these rules apply, with any necessary modification, to a pending proceeding, and anything required or permitted to be done under these rules with respect to a proceeding commenced on or after the commencement date is required or permitted to be done in a pending proceeding.\n                (3) These rules do not apply to a civil proceeding commenced in the Court on or after the commencement date to which any other Part of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 applies except as that Part provides.\n                (4) The repeal of the former rules does not affect anything done or omitted to be done in a pending proceeding before the commencement date and, except as provided in this Schedule, anything so done or omitted to be done before the commencement date is taken to have been done or omitted under these rules.\n                (5) Where the time for entering an appearance in any pending proceeding is limited by the originating process in the proceeding and before the commencement date any defendant or respondent had not entered an appearance in the proceeding, the time limited for the purpose of entering an appearance by that defendant or respondent under these rules is the time limited in the originating process.\n                (6) If before the commencement date, originating process issued in a pending proceeding for service on a defendant out of Tasmania had not been served on that defendant, the former rules continue to apply with respect to the service of the originating process on that defendant as if these rules had not been made and, in particular –\n                        (a) the Court may make an order authorising service of the originating process on that defendant; and\n                        (b) nothing in these rules affects any order authorising such service made before the commencement date; and\n                        (c) if the defendant is served out of Tasmania in accordance with an order of the Court, and does not enter an appearance within the time limited, the plaintiff is entitled to enter or apply for judgment, and Part 11 applies, with any necessary modification, as if the proceeding had been commenced by writ after the commencement date and the writ served on the defendant within Tasmania.\n                (7) If originating process issued in a pending proceeding has not been served on a defendant or respondent who is out of Tasmania, the former rules continue to apply with respect to the service of the originating process on the defendant or respondent out of Tasmania as if these rules had not been made, and, in particular, concurrent originating process may, in accordance with Order 6 of the former rules, be issued for the purpose of such service.\n                (8) If an endorsement of claim on a writ in a pending proceeding did not stand in place of or otherwise constitute a statement of claim under the former rules, then, in respect of any defendant to whom the plaintiff had not delivered a statement of claim before the commencement date, the plaintiff is to deliver a statement of claim to that defendant –\n                        (a) if the defendant entered an appearance before the commencement date, within 21 days after the commencement date; or\n                        (b) if the defendant enters an appearance after the commencement date, within 21 days after appearance.\n                (9) An endorsement of claim on a writ in a pending proceeding which stood in place of or otherwise constituted a statement of claim under the former rules is taken to be a statement of claim for the purpose of these rules.\n        3.
