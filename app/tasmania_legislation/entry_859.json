Registration of trusts\n    Except as hereinafter mentioned, every application to register any trust under this Act must be made by the same authority that is necessary for the appointment of a new trustee of such trust, and the vesting of the trust property, and every part thereof in such new trustee, whether solely or together with any surviving or continuing trustees, and, in case of any trust for purposes connected with any religious denomination, with the consent of the registered head or representative of such denomination in Tasmania or in the part of Tasmania to which such trust relates, and, in all other cases, with the consent of the Attorney-General.\n\n5.
