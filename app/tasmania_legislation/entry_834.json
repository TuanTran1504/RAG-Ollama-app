Corresponding provision\n        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a provision (the \"old provision\") of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation corresponds to a provision (the \"new provision\") of the new corporations legislation or the new ASIC legislation (and vice versa) if –\n                (a) the old provision and the new provision are substantially the same, unless the regulations specify that the 2 provisions do not correspond; or\n                (b) the regulations specify that the 2 provisions correspond.\n        (2) For the purposes of this Act, a provision (the \"old provision\") of a previous State corporations law corresponds to a provision (the \"new provision\") of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction (and vice versa) if –\n                (a) the old provision and the new provision are substantially the same, unless the regulations specify that the 2 provisions do not correspond; or\n                (b) the regulations specify that the 2 provisions correspond.\n        (3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a) or (2)(a) , differences of all or any of the following kinds are not sufficient to mean that 2 provisions are not substantially the same:\n                (a) differences in the numbering of the provisions;\n                (b) differences of a minor technical nature (for example, differences in punctuation, or differences that are attributable to the correction of incorrect cross-references);\n                (c) the fact that one of the provisions refers to a corresponding previous law and the other does not;\n                (d) for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) , the fact that –\n                        (i) the old provision allowed a court to exercise powers on its own motion but the new provision does not; or\n                        (ii) the old provision required a court to apply a criterion of public interest but the new provision requires a court to apply a criterion of justice and equity; or\n                        (iii) the new provision requires ASIC to take account of public interest but the old provision did not;\n                (e) for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) , other differences that are attributable to the fact that the new corporations legislation and the new ASIC legislation apply as Commonwealth laws in this and other States and in the internal Territories;\n                (f) other differences of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.\n        (4) Subsection (3) is not intended to otherwise limit the circumstances in which 2 provisions are, for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) or (2)(a) , substantially the same.\n        (5) The regulations may provide that –\n                (a) a specified provision of the old corporations legislation does, or does not, correspond to a specified provision of the new corporations legislation; and\n                (b) a specified provision of the old ASIC legislation does, or does not, correspond to a specified provision of the new ASIC legislation; and\n                (c) a specified provision of a previous State corporations law does, or does not, correspond to a specified provision of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction.\n\n5. Operation of Act\n    This Act has effect despite any provision of the old application Act or of the applicable provisions (as defined in that Act) of the State.\n\nPART 2 - Transitional provisions\n\n6. National scheme laws\n        (1) The national scheme laws of this jurisdiction operate of their own force only in relation to –\n                (a) matters arising before the relevant time; and\n                (b) matters arising, directly or indirectly, out of such matters –\n        in so far as those matters are not dealt with by the new corporations legislation, the new ASIC legislation or the co-operative scheme laws.\n        (2) Except as provided by subsection (1) and section 9 , the national scheme laws of this jurisdiction have no operation of their own force at and after the relevant time.\n\n7. Effect of section 6\n        (1) To the extent that a national scheme law of this jurisdiction ceases to operate of its own force because of section 6 , the effect is that which would have resulted had this Act and that law been Commonwealth Acts in relation to which the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth as in force on 1 November 2000 applied.\n        Note: Part III of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth contains provisions dealing with the effect of repeal of an Act. These provisions protect accrued rights and liabilities and allow legal proceedings in respect of them to be commenced or continued. However, this section and section 9 have the effect of cancelling certain rights and liabilities and terminating certain legal proceedings.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n        \n            (2) Despite subsection (1) , if by force of Chapter 10 of the new Corporations Act or Part 16 of the new ASIC Act a person acquires, accrues or incurs a right or liability in substitution for a pre-commencement right or liability, the pre-commencement right or liability is cancelled at the relevant time and ceases at that time to be a right or liability under a law of the State.\n            (3) Despite subsection (1) , a proceeding in a court that –\n                    (a) was started before the relevant time; and\n                    (b) was –\n                            (i) under a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or\n                            (ii) brought as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; and\n                    (c) was a proceeding to which section 1383 of the new Corporations Act or section 267 of the new ASIC Act applies at the relevant time; and\n                    (d) had not been concluded or terminated before the relevant time –\n            is terminated at the relevant time by force of this subsection.\n            (4) Despite subsection (1) , if by force of a Commonwealth Act (other than the new Corporations Act) referred to in sections 1393 to 1396 of the new Corporations Act a person becomes liable to pay an amount that is the same, and is in respect of the same matter, as an amount (the \"pre-commencement amount\") that was payable by the person before the relevant time under a provision of the old corporations legislation, the person's liability to pay the pre-commencement amount is cancelled at the relevant time and ceases at that time to be a liability under a law of the State.\n            (5) In subsection (2) –\n                pre-commencement right or liability means a right or liability, whether civil or criminal, other than a right or liability under an order made by a court before the relevant time or a liability referred to in section 1397(4) of the new Corporations Act, that –\n                        (a) was acquired, accrued or incurred under –\n                                (i) a carried-over provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or\n                                (ii) a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation that was no longer in force immediately before the relevant time; and\n                        (b) was in existence immediately before the relevant time.\n            (6) Nothing in this Act revives the co-operative scheme laws or otherwise affects the superseding of those laws by the national scheme laws of this jurisdiction as provided by Division 2 of Part 13 of the old application Act and any regulations made under section 80 of that Act for the purposes of that Division.\n\n    8. Certain provisions of State law taken to operate despite national scheme law\n            (1) Any provision of a relevant law of the State that –\n                    (a) makes (or, if not in force, would make on coming into force) provision in relation to a matter in a manner that is inconsistent with a provision or provisions of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction; or\n                    (b) but for the operation of section 5 of the old application Act, would have made (or, if not in force, would have made on coming into force) provision in relation to a matter in a manner that is inconsistent with a provision or provisions of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction –\n            is declared by this subsection to have effect despite the provision or provisions of the national scheme law of this jurisdiction with which it is inconsistent and as if the relevant law, or (in the case of a relevant law that is not an Act) the Act under which the relevant law was made, had itself provided expressly for this outcome.\n            Note: Section 5G of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth applies to a provision of a State law that is inconsistent with a provision of the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies if that provision operated, immediately before the commencement of that Act, despite the provision of the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC Law that corresponds to the Commonwealth provision.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n            \n                (2) Any provision of a relevant law of the State that provides that the whole of a previous State corporations law or a specified provision of a previous State corporations law does not apply to a matter is declared by this subsection to also provide that the whole of the old Corporations Law and the old ASIC Law or the corresponding provision (if any) of the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC Law (as the case requires) does not apply to that matter.\n                Note: Under section 5F(4) of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, if the old Corporations Law or the old ASIC law, or a provision of that Law, did not apply to a matter immediately before the commencement of that Act, then the Corporations legislation to which Part 1.1A of that Act applies, or the corresponding provision of that legislation, does not apply to the matter.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n                \n                    (3) Subsection (1) or (2) does not apply to a provision of a relevant law of the State (or a class of provision of relevant laws of the State) specified by the regulations as a provision (or class of provision) to which the subsection does not apply.\n                    (4) For the purposes of subsection (1) , a provision of a relevant law of the State is inconsistent with a provision of a national scheme law of this jurisdiction if it would be inconsistent within the meaning of section 109 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia if the national scheme law were an Act of the Commonwealth.\n                    (5) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 6 of the old application Act in relation to an Act enacted before the commencement of that section or an instrument made under such an Act.\n                    (6) In this section –\n                        matter includes act, omission, body, person or thing;\n                        relevant law of the State means a law of the State enacted or made before the relevant time (whether or not it is in force before that time) other than a national scheme law of this jurisdiction or a previous State corporations law.\n\n            9. Court proceedings and orders\n                    (1) This section applies to a proceeding, whether criminal or civil, in relation to which the following paragraphs are satisfied:\n                            (a) the proceeding was started in a court before the relevant time;\n                            (b) the proceeding was –\n                                    (i) under a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation; or\n                                    (ii) brought as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against a provision of the old corporations legislation or the old ASIC legislation;\n                            (c) the proceeding was not a proceeding to which section 1383 or 1384 of the new Corporations Act or section 267 or 268 of the new ASIC Act applies;\n                            (d) the proceeding had not been concluded or terminated before the relevant time.\n                    (2) Without limiting section 7(1) but subject to subsection (3) , a proceeding to which this section applies may be continued, and any order made by a court in such a proceeding may be appealed against, reviewed or enforced as if section 6 had not been enacted.\n                    (3) Nothing in this Part, or in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth as applying by force of section 7(1) , operates to preserve the effect of an order to which section 1383(5) of the new Corporations Act or section 267(5) of the new ASIC Act applies and, at the relevant time, that order ceases to have effect as an order of the court by which it was made and any proceeding in relation to such an order is terminated by force of this subsection.\n                    (4) For the avoidance of doubt, Part 9 of the old application Act continues to have the same application to a proceeding to which this section applies as it did before the relevant time.\n                    (5) In this section –\n                        proceeding includes –\n                                (a) a proceeding by way of appeal against, or otherwise seeking review of, an order made by a court; and\n                                (b) a proceeding to enforce an order made by a court; and\n                                (c) any other proceeding in respect of a breach of an order made by a court.\n\n            10. Existing rules of court continue to have effect\n                The rules of court made under section 51 of the old application Act and all other enabling powers, as in force immediately before the relevant time, continue to have effect (and may be dealt with) at and after the relevant time as if –\n                        (a) they were rules of court in force under section 23 ; and\n                        (b) they were made for the purposes of the provisions of the corporations legislation (within the meaning of section 23 ) that correspond to the provisions of the old Corporations Law for which they were made.\n\n            11. References to old/new corporations legislation or old/new ASIC legislation\n                    (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) , a reference in, or taken immediately before the relevant time to be in, an Act, an instrument made under an Act or a law applying as a law of the State by force of an Act to –\n                            (a) a Law, Regulations or instrument of a kind specified in column 1 of the Table in Schedule 1 is taken, at and after the relevant time, to include a reference to the Act, Regulations or instrument of the kind specified opposite it in column 2 of that Table; or\n                            (b) a provision or group of provisions of a Law, Regulations or instrument of a kind specified in column 1 of the Table in Schedule 1 is taken, at and after the relevant time, to include a reference to the corresponding provision or provisions (if any) of the Act, Regulations or instrument of the kind specified opposite it in column 2 of that Table.\n                    (2) The regulations may do either or both of the following:\n                            (a) provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to prescribed references, or references of a prescribed kind –\n                                    (i) in prescribed Acts or instruments made under Acts; or\n                                    (ii) in prescribed laws applying as laws of the State by force of an Act; or\n                                    (iii) in Acts, instruments made under Acts, or laws applying as laws of the State by force of an Act, of a prescribed kind;\n                            (b) provide that subsection (1) applies in relation to prescribed references, or references of a prescribed kind –\n                                    (i) in prescribed Acts or instruments made under Acts; or\n                                    (ii) in prescribed laws applying as laws of the State by force of an Act; or\n                                    (iii) in Acts, instruments made under Acts, or laws applying as laws of the State by force of an Act, of a prescribed kind –\n                            as if, in that subsection, the words \"to be a reference\" were substituted for the words \"to include a reference\".\n                    (3) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to references in, or taken immediately before the relevant time to be in –\n                            (a) the old application Act or the applicable provisions (as defined in that Act) of the State; or\n                            (b) a previous State corporations law or an instrument made under such a law; or\n                            (c) this Act or any regulations made under this Act; or\n                            (d) the Corporations (Consequential Amendments) Act 2001 ; or\n                            (e) the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 ; or\n                            (f) any other Act, or any provision of an Act, or any kind of Act or provision of an Act, specified by the regulations;

or\n                            (b) a provision or group of provisions of such an Act, regulations or other instrument –\n                    is taken, in relation to events, circumstances or things that happened or arose at a time before the relevant time, to include (unless the contrary intention appears or the context of the reference otherwise requires) a reference to the corresponding provision or provisions of the old corporations legislation, or the old ASIC legislation, as the case requires, of this jurisdiction and of each other jurisdiction referred to in sections 12(2) and (3) and 64(2) and (3) of the old application Act.\n                    (6) The regulations may do either or both of the following:\n                            (a) provide that subsection (5) does not apply in relation to prescribed references, or references of a prescribed kind –\n                                    (i) in prescribed Acts or instruments made under Acts;

Modifications to applied law\n                    (1) This Part operates to apply a provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, as a law of the State subject to the following modifications:\n                            (a) such modifications as may be specified by or under the law containing the declaratory provision;\n                            (b) a reference to ASIC is (unless a function under an applied law is conferred on ASIC as referred to in section 17 ) taken to be a reference to –\n                                    (i) the Minister administering the declaratory provision or such other person (or person belonging to a class of person) as may be specified by the regulations (whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law); or\n                                    (ii) such other person as may be specified by or under the declaratory provision;\n                            (c) a reference to the Gazette is a reference to the Tasmanian Government Gazette;\n                            (d) a reference to the Minister is a reference to the Minister administering the declaratory provision;\n                            (e) a reference to this jurisdiction is a reference to Tasmania;\n                            (f) such other modifications as are necessary or that are prescribed by regulations made under this Act, whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law.\n                    (2) Any power to make regulations under an Act containing a declaratory provision extends to the making of regulations specifying modifications for the purposes of this Part.\n                    (3) Except as provided by subsection (1) , definitions and other interpretation provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of the Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, relevant to the applied law are taken also to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision.\n                    (4) This section has effect subject to sections 17 to 20 .\n\n            17. Conferral of functions on ASIC\n                    (1) Neither a declaratory provision nor an applied law operates to confer a function on ASIC in relation to the applied law unless –\n                            (a) the declaratory provision provides for ASIC to perform that function pursuant to an agreement or arrangement of the kind referred to in section 11(8) or (9A)(b) of the new ASIC Act; and\n                            (b) ASIC is authorised to perform that function under section 11 of the new ASIC Act.\n                    (2) If a declaratory provision operates to confer a function on ASIC in relation to an applied law, the conferral of that function is taken not to impose a duty to perform that function despite anything to the contrary in the applied law.\n\n            18. Conferral of functions or duties on State courts\n                An applied law that confers a function or duty on a court or on the Court is taken to confer that function or duty (along with the jurisdiction to perform that function or duty) on the Supreme Court or such other court of the State as may be specified by or under the declaratory provision.\n\n            19. Implied application of regulations and other provisions of Corporations legislation\n                    (1) Unless a declaratory provision provides otherwise, the following provisions of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, are also taken to apply to a matter that is the subject of a declaratory provision as if they were laws of the State:\n                            (a) the provisions of any regulations made under the applied law;\n                            (b) any provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, that creates an offence in relation to a contravention of the applied law or specifies the penalty for an offence created by a provision of the applied law;\n                            (c) the provisions of Part 9.4B (Civil consequences of contravening civil penalty provisions) of the new Corporations Act for the purposes of any provision of the applied law that is a civil penalty provision within the meaning of that Part.\n                    (2) The regulations may prescribe modifications (whether generally or in relation to a particular applied law) of any of the provisions that are also taken to apply to a matter by force of subsection (1) for the purposes of that application.\n\n            20. Proceedings for offences\n                    (1) Proceedings for an offence against an applied law may be dealt with as an offence against a law of the State.\n                    (2) For the purposes of an offence against an applied law –\n                            (a) the amount of a penalty unit specified in relation to that offence by the applied law, or a provision taken by force of section 19(1) to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision, is $100; and\n                            (b) the laws of the State apply in relation to that offence as if the applied law, or a provision taken by force of section 19(1) to apply to the matter that is the subject of the declaratory provision, were a law or laws of the State.\n                    (3) Without limiting subsection (2)(b) , the laws of the State referred to in that subsection as applying in relation to an offence include laws with respect to –\n                            (a) the investigation and prosecution of offences; and\n                            (b) the arrest, custody, bail, trial, finding of guilt and conviction of persons charged with offences; and\n                            (c) proceedings relating to a matter referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) ; and\n                            (d) the classification of offences as indictable or summary or indictable triable summarily; and\n                            (e) appeals and reviews relating to criminal proceedings and to proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (c) ; and\n                            (f) the sentencing, punishment and release of persons found guilty or convicted of offences; and\n                            (g) fines, penalties and forfeitures; and\n                            (h) confiscation of the proceeds of crime.\n\n            21. Application of Corporations legislation by other means\n                Nothing in this Part prevents a law of the State from applying any provision of the Corporations legislation, or of an Act, regulations or other instrument forming part of the Corporations legislation, as a law of the State otherwise than by means of a declaratory provision.\n\n            PART 4 - General\n\n            22. Power to amend certain statutory rules\n                    (1) The Governor, on the recommendation of the Minister, may make regulations amending a statutory rule made by the Governor in the exercise of a power conferred by any Act.\n                    (2) The Minister may make a recommendation under subsection (1) only if he or she considers that each amendment proposed to be made by the regulations is consequential on the enactment, or the proposed enactment, by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of –\n                            (a) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 ; or\n                            (b) the Corporations Act 1989 ; or\n                            (c) an Act amending an Act referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) ; or\n                            (d) the new ASIC Act; or\n                            (e) the new Corporations Act.\n                    (3) Part 2 of the Subordinate Legislation Act 1992 does not apply to regulations made under this section.\n                    (4) Nothing in this section prevents a statutory rule from being amended otherwise than by regulations made under this section, including an amendment of a kind referred to in subsection (2) .\n\n            23. Rules of the Supreme Court\n                    (1) The Judges of the Supreme Court or a majority of them may make rules of court –\n                            (a) with respect to proceedings, and the practice and procedure, of that Court under the Corporations legislation; and\n                            (b) with respect to any matter or thing that is –\n                                    (i) required or permitted by the Corporations legislation to be prescribed by rules within the meaning of the Corporations legislation; or\n                                    (ii) necessary or convenient to be prescribed by such rules for carrying out or giving effect to the Corporations legislation; and\n                            (c) without limitation, with respect to costs, and with respect to rules as to meetings ordered by that Court.\n                    (2) When a lower court of Tasmania is exercising jurisdiction with respect to matters arising under the Corporations legislation, the court must apply the rules of court made under subsection (1) , with such alterations as are necessary.\n                    (3) In this section –\n                        Corporations legislation means –\n                                (a) the new Corporations Act; and\n                                (b) the new ASIC Act; and\n                                (c) the regulations made under the new Corporations Act and the new ASIC Act.\n\n            24.
