Penalty for destruction, &c., of permanent marks\n        (1) No person shall destroy, remove, injure, or deface, or directly or indirectly cause any alteration in the position of, any permanent mark established or adopted under this Act.\n        Penalty: Fine of not less than 2 penalty units and not more than 20 penalty units.\n        (2) Upon the conviction of any person for any offence against this section, the court may, in addition to imposing a penalty under subsection (1) hereof, order that the defendant shall pay to the public authority, committee of management, or body of trustees charged with the maintenance of the permanent mark in respect of which the proceedings were instituted, such amount as the court thinks reasonably necessary to reimburse the public authority, committee, or body of trustees for any expenses incurred in replacing or re-establishing the mark.\n        (3) Where the removal or alteration of any permanent mark is necessary by reason of any operations connected with the erection or reconstruction of any building, the removal or alteration of the mark for that purpose shall not constitute a contravention of this section, but the removal or alteration thereof may be effected subject to such provisions as to notice and report to the Surveyor-General, and re-establishment of the permanent mark, as may be prescribed.\n\n20A.\n\n20AB.\n\n20B.\n\n20C.\n\n20D.\n\n20E.\n\n20F.\n\n20G.\n\n20H.\n\n20J.\n\n20K.\n\n21.
