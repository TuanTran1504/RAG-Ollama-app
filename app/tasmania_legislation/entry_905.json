Functions and powers conferred on Commonwealth officers and authorities\n        (1) A Commonwealth administrative law applying because of section 15 that confers on a Commonwealth officer or authority a function or power also confers on the officer or authority the same function or power in relation to a matter arising in relation to the applied provisions.\n        (2) In performing a function or exercising a power conferred by this section, the Commonwealth officer or authority must act as nearly as practicable as the officer or authority would act in performing or exercising the same function or power under the Commonwealth administrative law.\n\nPART 6 - Miscellaneous\n\n17.
