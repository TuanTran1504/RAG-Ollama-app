Functions and powers conferred on Commonwealth authorities\n        (1) A Commonwealth administrative law applying because of section 35 that confers on an officer or authority of the Commonwealth a function or power in relation to an act, matter or thing arising under or in respect of an applicable provision of the Capital Territory also confers on the officer or authority the same function or power in relation to an act, matter or thing arising under or in respect of the corresponding applicable provision of Tasmania.\n        (2) A Commonwealth administrative law applying because of section 36 that confers on an officer or authority of the Commonwealth a function or power in relation to an act, matter or thing arising under or in respect of an applicable provision of the Capital Territory also confers on the officer or authority the same function or power in relation to an act, matter or thing arising under or in respect of the corresponding applicable provision of another jurisdiction.\n        (3) The function or power referred to in subsection (2) may only be performed or exercised in Tasmania.\n        (4) In performing a function or exercising a power conferred by subsection (1) or (2) an officer or authority of the Commonwealth must act as nearly as practicable as the officer or authority would act in performing or exercising the same function or power in relation to an act, matter or thing arising under or in respect of the corresponding applicable provision of the Capital Territory.\n        (5) A Commonwealth law applying because of section 35 or 36 applies as if it did not contain any provision empowering a Minister of State for the Commonwealth to give any directions in relation to the performance of a function or the exercise of a power conferred by subsection (1) or (2) .\n\n38. Reference in Commonwealth administrative law to a provision of another law\n    A reference in a Commonwealth administrative law to a provision of that or another Commonwealth administrative law is taken for the purposes of section 35 or 36 to be a reference to that provision as applying because of that section.\n\n39.\n. . . . . . . .\n\nPART 9 - Jurisdiction and procedure of Courts\n\nDivision 1 - Vesting and cross-vesting of civil jurisdiction\n\n40.
