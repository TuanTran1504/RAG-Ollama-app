Acquisition of land for future use\n        (1) The powers of a corporation to acquire land for highway purposes, or to acquire highway rights over land, may be exercised notwithstanding that the land is not intended immediately to be used for any of those purposes.\n        (2) Where highway rights have been acquired by a corporation over any land, no person may claim a right of passage over that land until the corporation opens the land to the public as a highway.\n        (3) Nothing in subsection (2) prejudices the operation of section 4 of the Highways Act 1951 .\n\n59. Development of land in connection with highway improvements\n        (1) In this section, development includes the erection, construction, alteration, or demolition of a building or work.\n        (2) Where a corporation is satisfied that, for promotion of the public interest, it is desirable that certain development in connection with highway improvements should be carried out on land adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, land used or to be used as a local highway, or that that land should be used only for certain purposes, it may make arrangements for the carrying out of that development or for ensuring that the land is used for those purposes or not for other purposes.\n        (3) For the purposes of this section, a corporation may acquire land and may enter into and carry out agreements with the owner of land with respect to the use or development of the land.\n        (4) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of subsection (2) , an agreement under this section may contain –\n                (a) such a covenant as is referred to in section 60 ;\n                (b) provisions for the dedication of land as a highway; and\n                (c) provisions for the grant of any such estates or interests as are referred to in section 61 .\n\n60. Restrictive covenants for benefit of highway\n        (1) In this section, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires, lease includes an agreement for a lease and leaseholder includes a tenant under an agreement for a lease.\n        (2) Where an agreement entered into for the purposes of section 59 by a person having an estate in any land contains a covenant, entered into by that person on behalf of himself, his successors in title, and the person deriving title under him or them, restricting the user of that land or any specified part of it, the covenant is enforceable by the corporation against the covenantor or any such person in like manner and to the like extent as if the covenant had been entered into by the fee simple owner of the land for the benefit of adjacent land held by the corporation in fee simple that was capable of being benefited by the covenant and as if that adjacent land continued to be so held by the corporation.\n        (3) Subject to this section, a corporation may, at any time, by agreement with the person against whom there is enforceable a covenant to which subsection (2) applies (in this section referred to as \"a covenant\"), discharge the covenant or may agree to a variation of the covenant.\n        (4) Subject to subsection (5) , where the land subject to a covenant is under the Land Titles Act 1980 , that Act has effect in relation to the covenant and the instrument creating it as if it were a covenant created under section 102 (7) of that Act for the benefit of land not under that Act and as if the corporation held an estate in fee simple in that land and was entitled wholly to discharge the covenant.\n        (5) Where a covenant is entered into by the registered proprietor of a lease under the Land Titles Act 1980 in respect of which no certificate of title has been issued, the Recorder of Titles shall enter a notification of the instrument on the folio of the Register, under the Land Titles Act 1980 , for the land and any folio of the Register, under the Land Titles Act 1980 , for the lease.\n        (6) Where the land subject to a covenant is not under the Land Titles Act 1980 , the covenant and a variation or discharge of it shall be under seal and shall be deemed to be an instrument affecting that land within the meaning of the Registration of Deeds Act 1935 .\n        (7) Where a covenant is entered into by a leaseholder, it remains in force (unless the instrument creating it contains a provision to the contrary) so long as the covenantor or a person deriving title under him other than a bona fide purchaser for value of the legal estate without notice of the covenant remains in possession of the land to which the covenant relates.\n        (8) Where the whole or any part of the land that is subject to a covenant is not under the Land Titles Act 1980 , the Recorder shall, on the application of the covenantor or any of his successors in title, bring under the Act so much of that land as is not under that Act by registering a qualified certificate of title to it in accordance with section 21 of that Act .\n        (9) The Recorder is not bound, for the purposes of subsection (8) , to investigate the title to any land.\n        (10) Where by this section the Recorder is required to bring any land under the Land Titles Act 1980 and no survey such as he could require under section 162 of that Act is available, the land may be described on the certificate of title by means of a description by metes and bounds instead of by reference to a plan.\n        (11) Where, in any certificate of title registered pursuant to this section, land is described by means of a description by metes and bounds –\n                (a) no action shall be brought against the Recorder or the assurance fund continued under the Land Titles Act 1980 by reason or in respect of a difference between the area of the land or the position or dimensions of the boundaries stated in the certificate of title and the actual area, position, or dimensions as found by admeasurement on the ground;\n                (b) an Australian lawyer who acts for a party taking or proposing to take an estate or interest in the land from the person shown in the certificate of title as the registered proprietor of the land is not under a duty to check the description in the antecedent document of title; and\n                (c) on such evidence of boundaries as he deems sufficient, the Recorder may cancel the certificate of title and replace it by a fresh certificate of title describing the land in accordance with the evidence.\n        (12) Section 84C of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1884 (which enables the Supreme Court or the Recorder of Titles in certain cases to discharge or modify restrictive covenants) does not apply to a covenant.\n\n61. Grant of private rights over lands held for highway purposes\n        (1) Where a corporation holds land for highway purposes, it may, as it considers expedient having regard to the purposes for which the land is held, create or convey estates and interests in the land, including any part of it through, in, or under which a relevant highway is or is to be carried, or a space or a building or other work that is or will be, in whole or in part, on or above or below its surface.\n        (2) In relation to any land, a reference in subsection (1) to a relevant highway shall be read as a reference to the highway to be opened through, over, or under the land and a highway for the widening or alteration of which the land is held.\n        (3) The exercise of the rights of passage over a highway is subject to any estates or interests granted under this section and those rights of passage are not to be exercised to the prejudice of the persons holding those estates or interests.\n        (4) Where a corporation acquires land for highway purposes from a person who retains land adjacent to or adjoining that taken, the corporation may, by deed poll, undertake to grant to the owner of the land so retained or a specified part of it such an estate or interest as is referred to in subsection (1) .\n        (5) In assessing the compensation for the acquisition of any land referred to in subsection (4) , regard shall be had to the value of the undertaking to the person to whom the compensation is payable.\n\n62. Special provisions as to acquisition for widening or other alteration\n        (1) A corporation may, in accordance with this section, take land for the widening or other alteration of a highway.\n        (2) Land shall not be taken under this section, unless –\n                (a) every part of it is within 3 metres of the boundary of an existing highway; and\n                (b) no building specified in subsection (3) is situated wholly or partly on the land or within 3 metres of its boundary –\n        but the existence of a building that has been substantially pulled down, destroyed, or demolished shall be disregarded for the purposes of this subsection.\n        (3) The buildings referred to in subsection (2) (b) are shops, dwellings, offices, warehouses, workshops, garages, and other similar buildings.\n        (4) Where the corporation intends to take land under this section, it may serve notice on the owner requiring the dedication of the land as a highway and informing him that in consideration of the dedication compensation is payable by the corporation as provided by this section.\n        (5) Where land has not been dedicated as required by a notice served under subsection (4) , the corporation may enter and take possession of the land if, at least 30 days previously, it has served notice on the owner stating that it intends to do so and specifying the amount of the compensation it considers that he will be entitled to receive.\n        (6) Where land has been dedicated under this section, the persons having estates or interests in the land are entitled to compensation determined in the same manner as a disputed claim for compensation under the Land Acquisition Act 1993 .\n        (7) For the purposes of the determination of the compensation payable under this section in respect of the dedication of any land, the value of the land shall be taken to be a sum of an amount that is 20 per cent greater than an amount that bears to the land value of the block of which it formed part the same proportion as the area of the land bears to the area of the block.\n        (8) No compensation is payable under this section in respect of the matters referred to in section 27 (1) (c) and (e) of the Land Acquisition Act 1993 , but, in the case of land taken for the widening of a highway, the corporation may, if in its opinion the widening will be detrimental to the block from which the land is taken, pay compensation in addition to that which it is otherwise required under this section to pay.\n        (9) In respect of the taking of land under this section, the compensation payable under the Land Acquisition Act 1993 is to include the costs of replacement or construction of any walls, fences, steps, ramps, and other works reasonably required as a consequence of the works carried out on the land and to preserve reasonable means of access from the block from which the land is taken to a highway.\n\n63. Letting of highways not presently used\n        (1) Where the corporation has acquired highway rights over any land, it may, if the land is not presently required to be opened as a highway, let that land to the owner of any adjoining land.\n        (2) Where any land in a city or town forming the site of a highway is not immediately required for use as a highway –\n                (a) the Minister for Crown Lands may, if that land is Crown land, do either or both of the following things:\n                        (i) grant leases of that land under the Crown Lands Act 1976 ;\n                        (ii) issue licences under that Act authorizing the use of that land for the purposes respectively specified in those licences; or\n                (b) the corporation may, if that land is not Crown land, take possession of that land and do either or both of the following things:\n                        (i) grant leases of that land;\n                        (ii) issue licences authorizing the use of that land for the purposes respectively specified in those licences.\n        (3) Before granting a lease or issuing a licence as provided in subsection (2) (a) , the Minister for Crown Lands shall cause a notice to be published in a local newspaper circulating in the locality in which the relevant highway is situated stating his intention to grant the lease or to issue the licence and appointing a day, at least 14 days after the date of the publication of the notice, on or before which written representations will be received by that Minister.\n        (4) Before granting a lease or issuing a licence under subsection (2) (b) , the corporation shall cause a notice to be published in a local newspaper circulating in the locality in which the relevant highway is situated stating its intention to grant the lease or issue the licence and appointing a day, at least 14 days after the date of the publication of the notice, on or before which written representations will be received by the corporation.\n        (5) A lease under subsection (2) (b) shall –\n                (a) be for such term, not exceeding 10 years, as the corporation thinks fit; and\n                (b) reserve the best rent which can be reasonably obtained for the land.\n        (6) A licence under subsection (2) (b) shall be –\n                (a) for such term, not exceeding 10 years, as the corporation thinks fit; and\n                (b) issued for such fee as the corporation thinks fit.\n        (7) During the currency of a lease granted, or of a licence issued, as provided in subsection (2) (a) or (b) , the public rights of passage over the land to which the lease or licence relates are suspended.\n\nPART V - Construction of Unmade Streets in Cities, Towns, and Other Urban Areas\n\n64.

Scheme of street construction\n        (1) Where the corporation intends, in accordance with this Part, to carry out street works in a street, it shall cause to be prepared a scheme for the carrying out of those works.\n        (2) One scheme may be prepared for the carrying out of street works in two or more streets.\n        (3) A scheme prepared for the purposes of this section shall contain –\n                (a) a description of the works, together with such specifications, maps, plans, sections, and elevations as the corporation thinks necessary;\n                (b) an estimate of the cost of the execution of the scheme;\n                (c) a list of the lands, if any, in respect of which the owners thereof are to be made liable for the cost of the execution of the scheme, with a description of each piece of land sufficient to identify it;\n                (d) a statement of the portion, whether the whole or part, of the cost of the execution of the scheme that is to be recovered from the frontagers and its estimated amount, and the respective estimated amounts that are to be recovered from each frontager as his share of the cost of the scheme; and\n                (e) such other particulars as the corporation considers necessary or expedient.\n        (4) The corporation shall not include the owner of any land among the owners of land to be made liable for the execution of the scheme unless the first-mentioned land fronts on, adjoins, abuts on, or (although not actually so fronting, adjoining, or abutting) is adjacent or accessible, to the street to which the scheme relates and –\n                (a) the owner of the land, by himself or those deriving title under him, has the right to use or commonly does use the street as a means of access to, or drainage from, the land; and\n                (b) the use or right to use is for the advantage or benefit of the land.\n        (5) In determining the portion of the cost of the execution of a scheme that is to be recovered from the frontagers –\n                (a) where any land is vested in the Crown, the corporation shall not, unless for reasons set out in the scheme it otherwise determines, include in such portion of the cost any amount of the cost that it considers would have been recoverable from the owner of that land if it were not vested in the Crown;\n                (b) where a carriage-way, drain, kerb, or footpath has previously been constructed and any person, as an owner of land, has under an Act contributed to the expense of the construction, the corporation shall not include any expense incurred in or in connection with the construction, alteration, or replacement of that carriage-way, drain, kerb, or footpath;\n                (c) the corporation shall take into consideration any other matters that, in the opinion of the corporation, are relevant and proper to be considered; and\n                (d) the corporation is not bound to require the frontagers or any of them to pay a greater portion of the cost than it thinks proper.\n        (6) In determining the respective amounts to be recovered from frontagers in relation to a scheme, the corporation shall take into consideration the frontage and area of their respective lands, the benefit to be derived by those lands from the carrying out of the street works, and any other matters that, in the opinion of the corporation, are relevant and proper to be considered.\n\n69. Inclusion of incidental expenses\n    The corporation may include in the estimate of the cost of the execution of a scheme –\n            (a) the cost (computed according to a usual method of costing) of the provision by the corporation of any materials, plant, and labour, including a reasonable amount for the use and depreciation of any plant so provided; and\n            (b) such sum (not exceeding 12·5 per cent of the estimated cost of the works) as the corporation thinks proper in respect of –\n                    (i) the making of searches and the preparation of specifications, maps, plans, sections, and elevations in connection with the works;\n                    (ii) the preparation of the scheme;\n                    (iii) the supervision and inspection of the works during construction; and\n                    (iv) printing and posting in connection with the scheme.\n\n70. Additional works and expenses\n        (1) The corporation may include in a scheme any additional works, not being street works within the meaning of this Part, and may include the cost of those works and any other additional expenses in the estimate of the cost of the scheme.\n        (2) No part of the cost of additional works or the additional expenses referred to in subsection (1) shall be included in the portion of the costs of the execution of the relevant scheme to be recovered from the frontagers at large or, unless he consents in writing, be charged to any of those frontagers.\n        (3) The actual and estimated cost of such additional works and additional expenses as are referred to in subsection (1) shall be deemed to be such respective amounts as the corporation's engineer certifies to be properly referable thereto.\n        (4) The additional costs and charges referred to in subsection (1) that a frontager consents to be charged with in respect of his land are a charge on that land.\n\n71. Notice of preparation of scheme\n    Where a scheme has been prepared, the corporation shall –\n            (a) cause a copy of the scheme to be kept at the office open for inspection by a person interested in or affected by the scheme until the scheme is finally settled or abandoned; and\n            (b) cause to be served on each owner of land intended to be made liable under the scheme a written notice stating –\n                    (i) that the scheme has been prepared and may be inspected at the municipal office;\n                    (ii) the estimated amount that is to be recovered from him as his share of the cost of the scheme;\n                    (iii) that within 14 days from the service of the notice he may, by written notice to the corporation, object to the scheme or any part of it; and\n                    (iv) the grounds on which such an objection may be made.\n\n72. Objection by owners\n        (1) Within 14 days after the service on an owner of land of a notice under section 71 in relation to a scheme, the owner may, by written notice served on the corporation, object to the scheme on any of the following grounds:\n                (a) that there has been a material informality, defect, or error in respect of the scheme or its preparation or that the scheme is invalid for any reason;\n                (b) that the amount of liability apportioned to him is erroneous;\n                (c) that an owner of land intended to be made liable under the scheme should not be made so liable or that an owner of land not intended to be made liable under the scheme should be made so liable;\n                (d) that it is intended to make frontagers or a frontager liable under the scheme for any costs or expenses for which they or he should not be made so liable;\n                (e) that, having regard to the standard requirements, the proposed works or any of them are unnecessary, insufficient, too costly, or unreasonable;\n                (f) that the portion of the cost of the execution of the scheme that is to be recovered from frontagers is excessive or unreasonable; and\n                (g) that the apportionment of liability among frontagers is unfair or that in the circumstances an excessive share of the cost of the scheme is to be recovered from a frontager.\n        (2) Where an objection to a scheme has been made under subsection (1) , the corporation may, in consideration of the withdrawal of the objection, undertake to amend the scheme in such manner as is specified in the undertaking, but, if the amendment would affect a frontager who did not make the objection, the corporation may not give an undertaking under this subsection unless that frontager notifies the corporation in writing that he does not object to the amendment.\n        (3) The corporation shall refer to a magistrate an objection made to a scheme under subsection (1) that has not been withdrawn and, on the hearing of the reference, the magistrate –\n                (a) may make an order quashing the scheme or directing that it may be adopted either without amendment or as amended in the manner specified in the order; and\n                (b) may make any further orders, including orders as to costs, as he thinks fit.\n        (4) On the hearing of a reference under subsection (3) in respect of an objection to a scheme, the corporation and the owner of the land in respect of which the objection was made are entitled to be heard and, before making an order specifying an amendment to the scheme, the magistrate shall give the owners of land who would be affected by the amendment an opportunity of being heard.\n\n73. Adoption and coming into effect of scheme\n        (1) A scheme may be adopted by the corporation –\n                (a) if no objections have been made to the scheme under section 72 or all the objections so made have been withdrawn; or\n                (b) if an order is made under section 72 by a magistrate directing that the scheme may be adopted –\n        but where an objection to the scheme was withdrawn on the giving of an undertaking under that section or the order referred to in paragraph (b) directed that the scheme may be adopted with amendment, the scheme, if it is adopted, shall be adopted as amended in the manner specified in that undertaking or order.\n        (2) A scheme comes into effect as adopted under this section and, notwithstanding a defect, error, or apparent invalidity in the scheme or in its preparation, adoption, or approval or in a procedure or matter relating thereto, is valid and shall not be challenged in any court, and every owner of land intended to be made liable under the scheme is liable accordingly.\n\n74. Execution of scheme\n        (1) Where a scheme comes into effect, the corporation may carry out, in accordance with the scheme, the street works specified in it.\n        (2) In carrying out the street works specified in a scheme, minor variations from the specifications of the scheme are permissible, but no extra expense incurred as the result of such a variation, which shall be deemed to be such amount as the council clerk certifies to be properly referable thereto, shall be included in the portion of the cost of the execution of the scheme to be recovered from the frontagers or, unless the clerk consents in writing, be charged to any of them.\n        (3) On the completion of the street works specified in a scheme –\n                (a) the corporation's engineer shall submit to the corporation a certificate stating the date of the commencement of the works on the ground and the date of their completion; and\n                (b) the council clerk shall submit to the corporation a certificate stating the actual cost of the execution of the scheme and the actual amount that is to be recovered under the scheme from the frontagers.\n\n75.

Payments by frontagers\n        (1) When a scheme comes into effect, the corporation shall serve on each frontager written notice stating the sum for which he is liable under the scheme (exclusive of any additional costs and expenses charged to him under the scheme with his consent) and, subject to this section, the owner becomes liable to pay that sum to the corporation.\n        (2) If the actual amount, as certified by the council clerk, of the portion of the cost of the execution of a scheme that is to be recovered from the frontagers at large is less than, or more than, the estimated amount as set out in the scheme, the liability of each frontager under the scheme is reduced or increased, as the case may be, so that his total liability bears to that actual amount the same proportion as the liability originally arising under subsection (1) bore to that estimated amount.\n        (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2) , the liability of a frontager shall not be increased under that subsection by more than 20 per cent.\n        (4) The sum payable in respect of land by a frontager under this section is a charge on that land and is payable by instalments in accordance with section 124 of the Local Government Act 1993 and, if his liability is reduced or increased under subsection (2) , the necessary adjustment shall be made by reducing or increasing by equal amounts the instalments subsequently becoming payable.\n        (5) The corporation may recover a sum that a person is for the time being liable to pay to it under this section, notwithstanding that his liability may subsequently be reduced, but the corporation shall repay a sum paid in excess of that required to discharge the liability as so reduced.\n\n77. State contribution\n        (1) Where a corporation has prepared a scheme for the carrying out of street works that comprise or include the construction of a carriage-way, the Minister for State Highways may, on the application of the corporation, undertake to make a contribution to the corporation of an amount equal to one-third of the cost of the construction of the carriage-way.\n        (2) A scheme in respect of which an undertaking is given under this section shall contain an estimate of the cost of the carrying out of the construction of the carriage-way to which the undertaking relates, that estimate in the scheme as prepared by the corporation, so far as the Minister for State Highways is satisfied with the estimate, being referred to in this section as the provisional estimate and the estimate in the scheme as it finally has effect, so far as that Minister is satisfied with that estimate, being so referred to as the final estimate.\n        (3) Where a scheme comes into effect in respect of which an undertaking has been given under subsection (1) , the Treasurer shall, at the request of the Minister for State Highways, pay to the corporation the contribution to which the undertaking relates, calculated on the basis of the final estimate.\n        (4) If the cost of the construction of a carriage-way, as certified by the council clerk, is less than the final estimate, one-third of the difference is a debt due to the Minister for State Highways by the corporation and, if it is more than that estimate, the Treasurer shall, on the application of the corporation, pay to it one-third of the difference, a sum falling due to be paid under this subsection being referred to in this section as a final adjustment.\n        (5) If the Minister for State Highways is dissatisfied with a certificate of the council clerk given for the purposes of subsection (4) , he may direct an investigation by the Secretary of the cost of the construction of the relevant carriage-way and the Secretary's certificate thereon has effect for the purposes of that subsection as if it were the certificate of the council clerk.\n        (6) Sums payable by the Treasurer under this section shall be paid by the Treasurer out of the Public Account, and an amount so payable is accordingly, by virtue of this subsection, appropriated to the extent necessary, and any sums paid under this section to the Minister for State Highways shall be paid into the Public Account.\n        (7) The Minister for State Highways shall not give an undertaking in a financial year under this section if the contribution that is required to be paid in pursuance of the undertaking, calculated on the basis of the provisional estimate, together with –\n                (a) the amount of the sums that have already fallen due to be paid under subsection (2) in respect of undertakings given in that financial year; and\n                (b) the amount that will fall due to be paid in respect of the other undertakings given in that financial year (calculated on the basis of the preliminary estimates) –\n        exceeds $50 000.\n        (8) For the purposes of subsection (7) , an undertaking given in respect of schemes that have been abandoned under section 80 shall be disregarded.\n        (9) Where, in the case of an undertaking given under this section, the amount of the sum falling due to be paid by the Treasurer as a final adjustment under subsection (4) exceeds 20 per cent of the amount of the sum payable under subsection (2) , the amount of $50 000 referred to in subsection (7) shall, in respect of the financial year in which that final adjustment becomes payable, be deemed to be reduced by the amount of the final adjustment.\n        (10) A reduction referred to in subsection (9) shall be deemed not to have been made in a financial year if the effect of making such a reduction would be that no further undertaking could be given under this section in that financial year by reason of the provisions of subsection (7) and, where no further undertaking could be so given, the sum of $50 000 referred to in subsection (7) shall be deemed to have been reduced by the amount of the final adjustment in respect of the following financial year.\n\n78. Application to boundary streets\n        (1) Where the boundary between an area to which this Part applies and an area to which it does not apply lies along a length of street, a scheme may provide for the construction of street works in that length of street that will lie wholly or partly outside an area to which this Part applies, but that scheme shall not provide for the recovery from frontagers of the cost of constructing works outside an area to which this Part applies or for the recovery of a sum from a person in respect of his ownership of land outside that area.\n        (2) Subsection (1) does not authorize the construction of works by a corporation outside its municipality except by agreement with the corporation of the municipality in which the works are to be constructed.\n        (3) Where the street works referred to in subsection (1) include or comprise the construction of a carriage-way, section 77 applies in relation to the works as if for the reference in subsection (1) of that section to one-third of the cost of the construction of the carriage-way there were substituted a reference to one-half of that cost.\n        (4) Where an undertaking is given by the Minister for State Highways under section 77 in respect of a scheme to which this section applies, subsection (6) of that section does not apply in respect of the sums required to be paid by the Treasurer in pursuance of the undertaking, but those sums shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament for the purpose.\n        (5) In relation to the street works referred to in subsection (1) , section 67 (3) does not require the construction or making good by a council of a footpath, kerb, or drain in the part of the street that is not within the municipality.\n\n79. Urgent works\n        (1) If it considers it urgently necessary to do so, a corporation may, without a scheme, carry out in a street any part of the works referred to in section 67 , and the cost of carrying out those works may be included in a scheme subsequently made by the corporation in respect of the remainder of those works carried out in that street, and, with any necessary modifications, this Part applies to the scheme as if the part of the works previously carried out were part of the works to be authorized by the scheme.\n        (2) The corporation shall maintain any works carried out under this section as if those works were part of a local highway maintainable by the corporation.\n        (3) A corporation that carries out any works in a street under this section or maintains any of those works does not, by reason of carrying out or maintaining those works, incur any liability to maintain the street.\n\n80. Abandonment of schemes\n        (1) The corporation may, by resolution, abandon a scheme, whether or not it has taken effect.\n        (2) If, within 3 years after a scheme has taken effect, the street works authorized by it have not been completed, the scheme shall, unless the Minister in writing otherwise directs, be deemed to have been abandoned.\n        (3) Where a scheme has been abandoned, all sums paid by a person under the scheme shall be refunded and no further sums are recoverable by the corporation under the scheme.\n        (4) Where a scheme is abandoned in respect of which an undertaking has been given under section 77 , any money paid to the corporation under the undertaking shall be repaid to the Treasurer.\n        (5) Notwithstanding that a scheme for the carrying out of street works in a street or a part of a street is abandoned pursuant to this section, the corporation may, subject to this Division, prepare, adopt, and execute another scheme for the carrying out of street works in the street or part of the street.\n\n81. Record of charges\n        (1) The corporation of a municipality shall keep such record or register that its officers can, within a reasonable time, inform a person who wishes to know the contributions that have been paid or are required to be paid by a frontager under this Part.\n        (2) A corporation that fails to keep a record or register that it is required to keep under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 2 penalty units.\n\n82.
