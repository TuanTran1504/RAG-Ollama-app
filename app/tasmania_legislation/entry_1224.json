Interpretation\n    In this Act –\n        statutory rule has the meaning assigned to that expression by the Rules Publication Act 1953 ;\n        subordinate instrument means an instrument that is –\n                (a) a statutory rule; or\n                (b) not a statutory rule but which is a regulation, rule, or by-law or any other instrument of a legislative character.\n\n4. Penalty units\n    Where, in any Act or subordinate instrument for the time being in force, a number (whether whole or fractional) of what in the Act or subordinate instrument are referred to as \"penalty units\" is prescribed as the penalty for an offence against that Act or subordinate instrument or is specified for some other purpose in that Act or subordinate instrument, then the Act or subordinate instrument shall, subject to section 37 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 , be construed as setting out a penalty of a number of dollars equal to the product obtained by multiplying the amount specified in the most recent notice published under section 4A(4) by the number of penalty units so prescribed or so specified.\n\n4A. Indexation of penalty units\n        (1) The value of a penalty unit for the financial year commencing on 1 July 2015 is $154.\n        (2) The value of a penalty unit for the financial year commencing on 1 July 2016, and for each subsequent financial year, is to be calculated in accordance with the following formula and rounded off in accordance with subsection (3) :\n        where –\n            A is the value in dollars of a penalty unit for the relevant financial year;\n            B is $154;\n            C is the value of the CPI figure for Hobart for the December quarter immediately preceding the financial year in which the value of the penalty unit is to apply;\n            D is the value of the CPI figure for Hobart for the December quarter 2014 (as published with the CPI figure for Hobart for the March quarter immediately preceding the financial year in which the value of the penalty unit is to apply).\n        (3) If the amount calculated in accordance with the formula specified in subsection (2) is an amount which is dollars and a number of cents, the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.\n        (4) On or before 1 June in each year, the Minister is to publish in the Gazette notice of the value of a penalty unit that is to apply for the financial year commencing on 1 July in that year.\n        (5) An increase in the value of a penalty unit is of no effect unless notice of the value of the penalty unit is published under subsection (4) .\n        (6) A notice under subsection (4) is not a statutory rule within the meaning of the Rules Publication Act 1953 .\n        (7) If, for a financial year, the value of a penalty unit calculated in accordance with the formula specified in subsection (2) results in a reduction in that value –\n                (a) the reduction is of no effect; and\n                (b) the notice published under subsection (4) is to specify that the value of a penalty unit for that financial year is to be the same as in the previous financial year.\n        (8) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Penalty Units and Other Penalties Amendment Act 2015 affects the validity of the value of a penalty unit calculated before the commencement of that Act.\n        (9) In this section –\n            CPI figure for Hobart means the Consumer Price Index: All Groups Index Number for Hobart published by the Australian Statistician under the authority of the Census and Statistics Act 1905 of the Commonwealth.\n\n5.
