Indemnity in criminal proceedings\n    It shall be a good defence to any person charged with any crime or offence committed before the commencement of this Act that the act charged would have been justifiable under the repealed Acts or any of them if they had been of full force and effect according to their tenor and that he believed it to be so, and that he so believed his unsworn statement shall be conclusive proof.\n\n60. Preservation of supposed existing rights of property between Crown and subject\n        (1) No action shall lie against the Crown or against any servant or agent of the Crown for any trespass vi et armis to person, land or goods, for any disseisin, for any detention or conversion of goods, or for the return of any money, where the trespass, disseisin, conversion or receipt of goods or money was in purported pursuance of the repealed Acts or any of them.\n        (2) No such action by the Crown or any servant or agent of the Crown suing on behalf of the Crown shall be defended on the ground that the defendant is entitled to re-enter, recapture or retain the land, goods or money the subject of the action by reason of some invalidity in the repealed Acts or any of them.\n\n61.

Refusal to deliver up lands\n    If any person in possession of any land vested in the Board under subsection (1) of section nine refuses to give up possession of the land or hinders the Board or any person authorized by the Board from taking possession of the land a judge may on the application of the Attorney-General grant a warrant authorizing the sheriff to deliver possession of the land to the Board.\n\n65. Protection of trustees\n    A trustee shall not be deemed to be or to have been guilty of any breach of trust or breach of duty by reason only of the fact that –\n            (a) he has, before the commencement of this Act, agreed not to claim compensation in respect of land resumed from him under the Lands Resumption Act 1910 , purportedly for the purposes of the Commonwealth and State War Service Land Settlement Agreement Act 1945 , in excess of the amount offered by the Crown;\n            (b) he has, before the commencement of this Act, agreed to accept and has accepted as the purchase price for any land purchased from him under the Lands Resumption Act 1910 , purportedly for the purposes of the Commonwealth and State War Service Land Settlement Agreement Act 1945 , the amount offered by the Crown.\n    In this section trustee includes personal representative of a deceased person, committee of the estate of a lunatic or idiot, the quasi-committee under section one hundred and fifty-five of the Supreme Court Civil Procedure Act 1932 of the estate of any person, committee appointed under the Mental Health Act 1963 , administrator of a convict's property, judge and Registrar of the Supreme Court, tenant for life under the Settled Land Act 1884 , person with the powers of a tenant for life under that Act, attorney, mortgagee, director of a company, and any other person acting in any fiduciary capacity.\n\n66. Interest\n        (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other Act no interest shall be payable in respect of any compensation money owing to the owner of any lands described in the third schedule except as provided in this section.\n        (2) The compensation money payable to the owner of any such lands shall bear interest at the rate of four per cent per annum from the date on which vacant possession was or is given to the Minister to the date of payment of the compensation money or to a date twelve months after the commencement of this Act whichever is the earlier.\n\n67. Costs\n        (1) All reasonable costs incurred by reason of any vesting of land by operation of this Act shall, subject to taxation by the Registrar of the Supreme Court, be paid by the Crown save in the case of an appeal: Provided that the total amount of such costs shall not in any case exceed $100.\n        (2) Any amount purporting to have been paid as costs in respect of the resumption of any such land and which has been so paid before the commencement of this Act shall operate as a satisfaction of any claim for costs arising under this Act.\n        (3) Upon the discontinuance of any action against the Crown or its officers relating to the resumption of land vested in the Board by subsection (1) of section nine the Court may if it considers that the action was properly brought and by reason of this Act alone properly discontinued award the plaintiff all or part of his costs.\n\n67A. Validation of certain leases\n    Where before the commencement of the War Service Land Settlement Act 1968 the Board has let proposed holdings to intending tenants for a period of one year and thereafter from year to year and not at will as provided in subsection (2) of section ten, the leases granted and accepted in those cases shall be deemed good under and for the purposes of that subsection and shall be effective according to their tenor.\n\nPART VI - Miscellaneous\n\n68.
