Limitation of liability by multiple of charges\n        (1) A scheme may provide that, if a person to whom the scheme applies and against whom a proceeding relating to occupational liability is brought is able to satisfy the court –\n                (a) that the person has the benefit of an insurance policy –\n                        (i) that insures the person against that occupational liability; and\n                        (ii) under which the amount payable in respect of that occupational liability is not less than an amount (the \"limitation amount\"), being a reasonable charge for the services provided by the person, or which the person failed to provide, and to which the cause of action relates, multiplied by the multiple specified in the scheme in relation to the class of person and the kind of work to which the cause of action relates; or\n                (b) that the person has business assets the net current market value of which is not less than the limitation amount; or\n                (c) that –\n                        (i) the person has business assets and the benefit of an insurance policy that insures the person against that occupational liability; and\n                        (ii) the net current market value of the assets and the amount payable under the policy in respect of that occupational liability, if combined, would total an amount that is not less than the limitation amount –\n        the person is not liable in damages in relation to that cause of action above the limitation amount or, if the scheme specifies a minimum cap determined by the Council for the purposes of the scheme that is higher than the limitation amount, above the amount of the minimum cap so specified.\n        (2) In determining the amount of a reasonable charge for the purposes of a provision made under subsection (1) , a court is to have regard to any amount actually charged and to –\n                (a) the amount that would ordinarily be charged in accordance with a scale of charges accepted by the occupational association of which the person is a member; or\n                (b) if there is no such scale, the amount that a competent person of the same qualifications and experience as the person would be likely to charge in the same circumstances.\n        (3) This section does not limit an amount of damages to which a person is liable if the amount is less than the amount specified for the purpose in the scheme in relation to the class of person and the kind of work concerned.\n\n27. Specification of different limits of liability\n    A scheme –\n            (a) may specify the same maximum amount of liability in relation to all cases to which the scheme applies or different maximum amounts of liability for different cases or classes of case, or for the same case or class of case for different purposes; and\n            (b) may confer a discretionary authority on an occupational association, on application by a person to whom the scheme applies, to specify in relation to the person a higher maximum amount of liability than would otherwise apply under the scheme in relation to the person either in all cases or a specified class of cases.\n            (c) . . . . . . . .\n\n28. Combination of provisions under sections 24 , 25 and 26\n    If, in a scheme, provisions of the kind referred to in section 26 and provisions of the kind referred to in section 24 or 25 (or both) apply to a person at the same time in respect of the same kind of work, the scheme must provide that the damages which may be awarded against the person are to be determined in accordance with section 26 but must not exceed the amount of the monetary ceiling specified in relation to the class of person and the kind of work in the provisions of the kind referred to in section 24 or 25 .\n\n29. Liability that cannot be limited by scheme\n    A scheme can only affect the liability for damages arising from a single cause of action to the extent to which the liability results in damages exceeding such amount (but not less than $500 000) as is specified in the scheme.\n\n29A. Liability in damages not reduced to below relevant limit\n    The liability in damages of a person to whom a scheme applies is not reduced below the relevant limitation imposed by a scheme in force under this Act because the amount required or available to be paid to the claimant under the insurance policy required for the purposes of this Act in respect of that liability is less than the relevant limitation.\n\n30. Insurance to be of requisite standard\n        (1) For the purposes of a scheme, an insurance policy must be a policy, or a policy of a kind, which complies with standards determined by the occupational association whose members may be insured under such a policy, or a policy of such a kind.\n        (2) While a scheme remains in force relating to its members, if an occupational association proposes to alter the standards previously determined by it in relation to an insurance policy or a kind of insurance policy, it must do so by way of an amendment to the scheme in accordance with the provisions of section 18 .\n\nDivision 3 - Effect of schemes\n\n31. Limit of occupational liability by schemes\n        (1) To the extent provided by this Act and the provisions of the scheme, a scheme limits the occupational liability, in respect of a cause of action founded on an act or omission occurring during the period when the scheme is in force, of any person to whom the scheme applied at the time when the act or omission occurred.\n        (2) A scheme does not limit the liability of a person (the \"professional\") to another person (the \"client\") if, at no stage before the time of the relevant act or omission, did the professional –\n                (a) give, or cause to be given, to the client a document that carried a statement of a kind referred to in section 36(1) ; or\n                (b) otherwise inform the client, whether orally or in writing, that the professional's liability was limited in accordance with this Part.\n        (3) Subsection (2) does not affect any limitation of the liability of a professional to a person other than the client.\n        (4) The applicable limitation of liability is the limitation specified by the scheme as in force at the time of the relevant act or omission.\n        (5) A limitation of liability that, in accordance with this section, applies in respect of an act or omission continues to apply to every cause of action founded on it, irrespective of when the cause of action arises or proceedings are brought in respect of it, and even if the scheme has been amended or has, in accordance with section 35 , ceased to be in force.\n        (6) A person to whom a scheme applies cannot choose not to be subject to the scheme, except in accordance with provisions included in the scheme under section 20(2) .\n\n32. Limitation of amount of damages\n        (1) A limitation imposed by a scheme in force under this Act of an amount of damages is a limitation of the amount of damages that may be awarded for a single claim and is not a limitation of the amount of damages that may be awarded for all claims arising out of a single event.\n        (2) Separate claims by two or more persons who have a joint interest in a cause of action founded on the same act or omission are to be treated as a single claim for the purposes of this Act.\n        (3) Two or more claims of the same type by the same person arising out of a single event against persons to whom a scheme in force under this Act applies and who are associated persons are to be treated as a single claim for the purposes of this Act.\n        (4) Persons are associated if they are –\n                (a) officers of the same body corporate (within the meaning of section 21 ); or\n                (b) partners, employees of the same employer or in the relationship of employer and employee; or\n                (c) persons who are prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.\n\n33. Effect of scheme on other parties to proceedings\n    A scheme does not limit the liability of a person who is a party to proceedings if the scheme does not apply to the person.\n\n34.
