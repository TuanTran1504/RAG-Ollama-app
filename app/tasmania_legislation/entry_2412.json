On the commencement of the Nature Conservation Act 2002, the area of land was taken to be reserved land in the class of State reserve under that Act. The area of land was named Palmers Lookout State Reserve by a proclamation notified in the Gazette as Statutory Rules 1999, No. 35.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n        \n    15 June 2009\n\n    PETER G.
