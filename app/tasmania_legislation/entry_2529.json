Repeals\n        (1) After the passing of this Act no penal enactment contained in any Imperial Act, not having the force of law in this State otherwise than by virtue of the provisions of section 24 of the Australian Courts Act 1828 , shall continue in force or be applied in the administration of justice in this State.\n        (2) The several Acts mentioned in Schedule 2 shall be repealed to the extent in the said schedule indicated.\n        (3) The repeal of any statute or part of a statute set forth in the said schedule shall not affect the construction of any other statute, or of any other part of the same statute.\n\n4. Construction of statutes\n        (1) After the passing of this Act every statute shall, for the purposes of this Act, be read and construed as if any offence therein mentioned for which the offender may be prosecuted on indictment or information (however such offence may be therein described or referred to) were described or referred to as a crime as defined by the Code ; and all provisions of this Act relating to crimes generally shall apply to every such offence.\n        (2) Where in any statute reference is made to proceedings upon information in the Supreme Court, the same shall be construed as a reference to proceedings upon indictment.\n        (3) Except as provided in section 36 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 , nothing contained in this Act or in the Code shall be construed to affect the construction of any statute, or of any provision thereof, creating an offence punishable summarily or referring or relating to summary proceedings.\n\n5. Trial by magistrate in certain cases\n        (1) Where in any unrepealed statute, passed before the passing of this Act, it is provided that any offence therein created, defined, or made punishable shall be punishable by any term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years (whether such offence is described as a misdemeanour, or otherwise), or that any offence shall be a misdemeanour, and no specific punishment is thereby provided for the same, every such offence shall be punishable summarily before a magistrate as herein provided.\n        (2) In every such case, as aforesaid, a magistrate shall have power to impose upon any person convicted of any such offence a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year, or such shorter period as may be provided by such statute, in addition to any fine or other punishment, if any, authorized thereby, or otherwise.\n        (3) In any case in which the term of imprisonment authorized by any such statute exceeds one year the magistrate before whom any person is charged with an offence thereunder may –\n                (a) if such person demands to be tried by jury; or\n                (b) if, in his opinion, the charge should be tried upon indictment –\n        commit such person for trial upon indictment under the Code .\n        (4) A person so committed shall thereupon be dealt with under the provisions of the Code relating to proceedings upon indictment, and may be punished in manner provided by such statute as aforesaid.\n        (5) The provisions of this section shall apply only in respect of offences which were intended by the Act constituting the same to be prosecuted upon information or indictment, and in respect of which no other mode of proceeding is provided by such Act or any other Act.\n\n6.

Saving of common law defences\n    All rules and principles of the common law which render any circumstances a justification or excuse for any act or omission, or a defence to a charge upon indictment, shall remain in force and apply to any defence to a charge upon indictment, except in so far as they are altered by, or are inconsistent with, the Code .\n\n9. No remedy in tort for act declared lawful: Civil remedies for crime not suspended\n        (1) Where by the Code any act is declared to be lawful, no action shall be brought in respect thereof.\n        (2) Except as aforesaid, the provisions of this Act shall not affect any right of action which any person would have had against another if this Act had not been passed; nor shall the omission from the Code of any penal provision in respect of any act or omission which, before the passing of this Act, constituted an actionable wrong affect any right of action in respect thereof.\n        (3) No civil remedy for any act or omission shall be suspended by reason that such act or omission amounts to a criminal offence.\n\n10. Saving of summary procedure at common law for contempt of court\n    Nothing in this Act shall affect the authority of courts of record to punish a person summarily for the offence commonly known as \"contempt of court\"; but no person shall be so punished and also punished under the provisions of the Code for the same act or omission.\n\n11.

Rules of Court\n        (1) The judges, or a majority of them, may make Rules of Court prescribing all such matters and things as are required to be prescribed or as may be necessary or desirable for giving effect to the provisions of the Code .\n        (1A) The Rules of Court may provide for –\n                (a) all matters relating to procedure and practice –\n                        (i) on appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal on questions reserved for the consideration and determination of that Court, or referred to that Court, pursuant to Chapter XLII of the Code; and\n                        (ii) on or after the committal of a defendant to the Supreme Court for sentence or trial; and\n                        (iii) in all proceedings before courts of trial; and\n                (b) all incidental matters.\n        (2) This section does not authorize the making of provision by a Rule of Court of any matter for which provision may be made under section 12A .\n\n12A.

Which parties to crimes to be deemed principals in the first degree\n        (1) Where a crime is committed, each of the following persons is deemed to be a party to, and to be guilty of, the crime, and may be charged with actually committing it:\n                (a) every person who actually commits the crime;\n                (b) every person who does any act or makes any omission for the purpose of enabling or aiding another person to commit the crime;\n                (c) every person who abets another person in committing the crime;\n                (d) every person who instigates any other person to commit the crime.\n        (2) Any person who instigates another to do any act or make any omission of such a nature that, if he had himself done the act or made the omission, the act or omission would have constituted a crime on his part, is guilty of the same crime as if he had himself done the act or made the omission; and may be charged with himself committing that crime.\n\n4. Crimes committed in prosecution of common purpose\n    Where 2 or more persons form a common intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose in conjunction with one another, and in the prosecution of such purpose a crime is committed of such a nature that its commission was a probable consequence of the prosecution of such purpose, each of them is deemed to have committed the crime.\n\n5. In case of instigators, mode of execution immaterial\n    Where a person instigates another to commit a crime, and a crime is actually committed after such instigation by the person instigated, it is immaterial whether the crime actually committed is the same as that instigated or not, or whether the crime is committed in the manner suggested or not; provided in either case that the facts constituting the crime actually committed are a probable consequence of carrying out the instigation. In any such case the instigator is deemed to have himself committed the crime actually committed.\n\n6. Accessories after the fact: When wives and husbands not so\n        (1) A person who receives or assists another who is, to his knowledge, guilty of a crime, in order to enable him to escape punishment, is said to become an accessory after the fact to such crime.\n        (2) A married woman does not become an accessory after the fact to a crime of which her husband is guilty, by receiving or assisting him in order to enable him to escape punishment; nor by receiving or assisting, in her husband's presence and by his authority, another person who is guilty of a crime in the commission of which her husband has taken part, in order to enable that other person to escape punishment; nor does a husband become accessory after the fact to a crime of which his wife is guilty by receiving or assisting her in order to enable her to escape punishment.\n\nChapter III - Application of Criminal Law\n\n7. Effect of changes in statute law\n        (1) No person shall be punished as for a crime if at the time of his trial the act or omission with which he is charged no longer constitutes a crime.\n        (2) If the law in force when a crime was committed differs from that in force at the time of the conviction therefor, the offender shall not be punished to any greater extent than was authorized by the former law, or than is authorized by the latter law.\n\n8.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n9. Instigation in this State of crimes committed elsewhere\n        (1) Any person who in this State instigates another to do an act or make an omission outside this State, which act or omission would constitute a crime on his part both in this State, if done or made by him here, and in the place where it occurs, if done or made by him there – is guilty of the same crime as if he had himself done the act or made the omission in this State, but the punishment shall not exceed that provided by the law in force in the place where the act or omission was done or made.\n        (2) No person shall be prosecuted under the provisions of this section except at the request of the Government of the State having jurisdiction where such act or omission is done or made.\n\n10. Military and naval forces\n    Officers and men of the military and naval forces are at all times subject to the provisions of the Code.\n\n11. Person not to be twice punished for same crime\n    Where a person is punishable under the Code, and also under any other statute, or under 2 or more sections of the Code or of any other statute, he may be tried and punished under the Code or such other statute or under either of such sections, as the case may be; but he shall not be punished twice in respect of the same act or omission, unless his act or omission renders him guilty of unlawfully causing the death of any person, and such death occurs after he has been once punished.\n\nChapter IV - Criminal Responsibility\n\n12. Ignorance of law\n    The fact that an offender is ignorant of the law is not an excuse for any offence committed by him, but it may be relevant to the question whether or not an act or omission which would constitute an offence if accompanied by a certain intention or state of mind was in fact accompanied by that intention or state of mind.\n\n13. Intention and motive\n        (1) No person shall be criminally responsible for an act, unless it is voluntary and intentional; nor, except as hereinafter expressly provided, for an event –\n                (a) that the person does not intend or foresee as a possible consequence; and\n                (b) that an ordinary person would not reasonably foresee as a possible consequence.\n        (1A) However, under subsection (1)(b) , a person is not excused from criminal responsibility for death, or grievous bodily harm, that results to a victim because of a defect, weakness or abnormality of the victim.\n        (2) Except as otherwise expressly provided, no person shall be criminally responsible for an omission, unless it is intentional.\n        (3) Any person who with intent to commit an offence does any act or makes any omission which brings about an unforeseen result which, if he had intended it, would have constituted his act or omission some other offence, shall, except as otherwise provided, incur the same criminal responsibility as if he had effected his original purpose.\n        (4) Except where it is otherwise expressly provided, the motive by which a person is induced to do any act or make any omission is immaterial.\n\n14. Mistake of fact\n    Whether criminal responsibility is entailed by an act or omission done or made under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of facts the existence of which would excuse such act or omission, is a question of law, to be determined on the construction of the statute constituting the offence.\n\n14A. Mistake as to consent in certain sexual offences\n        (1) In proceedings for an offence against section 124 , 125B , 127 or 185 , a mistaken belief by the accused as to the existence of consent is not honest or reasonable if the accused –\n                (a) was in a state of self-induced intoxication and the mistake was not one which the accused would have made if not intoxicated; or\n                (b) was reckless as to whether or not the complainant consented; or\n                (c) did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to him or her at the time of the offence, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting to the act.\n        (2) In proceedings for an offence of attempting to commit an offence against section 124 , 125B or 185 , absence of intention to commit the attempted offence is not a defence if it is established that the absence of intent was due to –\n                (a) self-induced intoxication; or\n                (b) a failure to take reasonable steps in the circumstances known to the accused at the time of the offence to ascertain that the complainant would have consented to the act constituting the offence against section 124 , 125B or 185 .\n\n14B.

Questions reserved to be stated in a case\n        (1) The judge by whom such question of law may have been so reserved shall thereupon state a case setting forth the question of law which shall have been so reserved, with the special circumstances upon which the same shall have arisen, and shall sign and transmit the same within a reasonable time to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal.\n        (2) Every question so reserved shall be dealt with in the same manner in every respect as is hereinafter provided with respect to appeals.\n\n388AA.

Abatement or removal of nuisance\n        (1) Upon a conviction of creating and continuing a nuisance or of continuing a nuisance the court may –\n                (a) adjourn the cause for a specified period to give the person convicted an opportunity to abate or remove the nuisance; or\n                (b) refer to the Associate Judge the questions of how and at what cost the nuisance may best be abated or removed, and otherwise adjourn the cause until the Associate Judge's report is available.\n        (2) On a reference under this section, the Associate Judge–\n                (a) shall make such an inquiry as he thinks proper;\n                (b) may obtain the opinion of engineers and other persons with scientific or technical knowledge; and\n                (c) shall hear, if they so desire, the prosecutor and the defendant–\n        and report in writing to the court accordingly.\n        (3) On receiving the Associate Judge's report the court shall cause the parties to be given copies of the report and to be summoned to appear before it.\n        (4) The cause being again before the court, either party may move that the report be rejected and a further and better report ordered, which the court may do with all necessary consequences.\n        (5) If after an adjournment under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) it appears to the court that the nuisance has not been abated or removed, the court may proceed under paragraph (b) of that subsection.\n        (6) On accepting a report of the Associate Judge, the court may sentence the defendant to pay a fine equal to the amount that he has reported that the abatement or removal of the nuisance will cost, and order that the fine be paid over to the Treasurer of the State, the treasurer of a municipality, or to some other authority as payment for abating or removing the nuisance according to such arrangement or contract therefor as the court approves.\n        (7) Money received by the Treasurer under subsection (6) shall be paid into an account established in the Public Account and not applied otherwise than for the abatement or removal of nuisances.\n        (8) If it is not convenient that the Associate Judge should act under this section the court may appoint any Australian legal practitioner to perform the same duties.\n\n388B. Punishment for creating nuisance\n        (1) When a person is convicted of creating and continuing a nuisance, the court may, in addition to any fine imposed under section 388A , impose a sentence in respect of the creating of the nuisance.\n        (2) Where under subsection (1) the judge of the court of trial is of opinion that both imprisonment and a fine should be imposed, he may sentence the person convicted at any time after the verdict and while the procedure of section 388A is going on and as part of the same sentence add the fine when it is clear what fine, if any, should be imposed under subsection (6) of that section.\n\nChapter XLIII - Punishments\n\n389.

Circumstances in which person may be charged with administration of justice crime relating to previous acquittal\n        (1) The Court may, on application by the Director of Public Prosecutions, order a person who has been acquitted of a crime to be tried for an administration of justice crime that is related to the crime of which the person has been acquitted if the Court is satisfied that –\n                (a) there appears to be fresh evidence against the acquitted person in relation to the administration of justice crime; and\n                (b) in all the circumstances it is in the interests of justice for the order to be made.\n        (2) If the Court orders a person to be tried for an administration of justice crime that is related to a crime of which the person has been acquitted, the Court must quash the person's acquittal or remove the acquittal as a bar to the person being tried.\n        (3) On the trial of a person for an administration of justice crime, section 355(1)(b) does not apply in relation to the charge of the administration of justice crime.\n        (4) For the purposes of this section, evidence is \"fresh\" if –\n                (a) it was not adduced in the proceedings in which the person was acquitted; and\n                (b) it could not have been adduced in those proceedings with the exercise of reasonable diligence.\n\n393.

Court may order retrial for a serious crime – tainted acquittal\n        (1) The Court may, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, order an acquitted person to be retried for a serious crime if satisfied that –\n                (a) the acquittal is a tainted acquittal; and\n                (b) in all the circumstances it is in the interests of justice for the order to be made.\n        (2) The Court may order a person to be retried for a serious crime under this section even if the person had been charged with and acquitted of a lesser crime.\n        (3) If the Court orders an acquitted person to be retried for a serious crime, the Court must quash the person's acquittal or remove the acquittal as a bar to the person being retried.\n        (4) On the retrial, section 355(1)(b) does not apply in relation to the charge of the serious crime.\n\n395. Fresh and compelling evidence – meaning\n        (1) This section applies for the purpose of deciding under this Chapter whether there is fresh and compelling evidence against an acquitted person in relation to a very serious crime.\n        (2) Evidence is \"fresh\" if –\n                (a) it was not adduced in the proceedings in which the person was acquitted; and\n                (b) it could not have been adduced in those proceedings with the exercise of reasonable diligence.\n        (3) Evidence is \"compelling\" if –\n                (a) it is reliable; and\n                (b) it is substantial; and\n                (c) in the context of the issues in dispute in the proceedings in which the person was acquitted, it is highly probative of the case against the acquitted person.\n        (4) Evidence that would be admissible on a retrial under this Chapter is not precluded from being fresh and compelling evidence merely because it would have been inadmissible in the earlier proceedings against the acquitted person.\n\n396. Tainted acquittal – meaning\n        (1) This section applies for the purpose of deciding under this Chapter whether the acquittal of an accused person is a tainted acquittal.\n        (2) An acquittal is \"tainted\" if –\n                (a) the accused person or another person has been convicted in this State or elsewhere of an administration of justice crime in relation to the proceedings in which the accused person was acquitted; and\n                (b) it is more likely than not that, but for the commission of the administration of justice crime, the accused person would have been convicted.\n        (3) An acquittal is not a tainted acquittal during any of the following periods:\n                (a) the period provided under section 407 for the person convicted of the administration of justice crime (the \"convicted person\") to appeal, or obtain leave to appeal, from the conviction;\n                (b) if, within the period mentioned in paragraph (a) , the convicted person gives notice of appeal, the period ending when the appeal is decided;\n                (c) if, within the period mentioned in paragraph (a) , the convicted person gives notice of an application for leave to appeal, the period ending –\n                        (i) if the application is refused, when the decision refusing the application is made; or\n                        (ii) if the application is granted, when the appeal is decided.\n        (4) If the conviction for the administration of justice crime is, on appeal, quashed after the Court has ordered the acquitted person to be retried under this Chapter because of the conviction, the person may apply to the Court to set aside the order and –\n                (a) restore the acquittal that was quashed; or\n                (b) restore the acquittal as a bar to the person being retried for the crime.\n\n397. Interests of justice – matters for consideration\n        (1) This section applies for the purpose of deciding under this Chapter whether it is in the interests of justice for an order to be made for the retrial of, or prosecution of an administration of justice crime against, an acquitted person.\n        (2) It is not in the interests of justice to make an order for the retrial of, or prosecution of an administration of justice crime against, an acquitted person unless the Court is satisfied that a fair retrial or trial is likely in the circumstances.\n        (3) The Court must have regard in particular to –\n                (a) the length of time since the acquitted person allegedly committed the crime; and\n                (b) whether any police officer or prosecutor has failed to act with reasonable diligence or expedition in relation to –\n                        (i) the investigation of the commission of the crime of which the person was acquitted and the prosecution of the proceedings in which the person was acquitted; and\n                        (ii) the application for the retrial of, or prosecution of an administration of justice crime against, the acquitted person.\n\n397A.

Determination of appeals\n        (1) On an appeal the Court shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment or order of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.\n        (2) The Court may, notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that the point raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\n        (3) Subject to the special provisions of this chapter, the Court shall, if it allows an appeal against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.\n        (4) On an appeal against a sentence, the Court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.\n        (4A) The Court, on hearing an appeal against a sentence passed on a person for an offence (whether the appeal was brought, made or lodged by the person or by the prosecutor), may take into account any matter relevant to the sentence that has occurred between when the court of trial dealt with the person and when the appeal is heard.\n        (4B) Despite subsection (4A) , the Court, in passing another sentence under subsection (4) , must not take into account the element of double jeopardy involved in the person being sentenced again, in order to pass a less severe sentence than the Court would otherwise consider appropriate.\n        (4C) Despite subsection (4) , on an appeal against a sentence the Court may, if it thinks that it is appropriate and in the interests of justice to do so, quash the sentence passed at the trial and remit the matter to the court of trial.\n        (4D) If the Court quashes a sentence passed at a trial and remits the matter to the court of trial under subsection (4C) –\n                (a) it may give any directions that it thinks fit concerning the manner and scope of the further hearing of the matter by the court of trial, including a direction as to whether that hearing is to be conducted by the same judge as, or a different judge to, the judge that passed the sentence; and\n                (b) the court of trial must hear and determine the matter in accordance with the law and any such directions; and\n                (c) the court of trial may take into account any matter relevant to sentencing that has occurred between when the court of trial passed the quashed sentence and when the court of trial decides the remitted matter; and\n                (d) despite paragraph (c) , the court of trial must not take into account the element of double jeopardy involved in the person being sentenced again, so as to pass a less severe sentence than the court of trial would otherwise consider appropriate.\n        (5) If the Court allows an appeal against an order arresting judgment or against an acquittal, it may make any of the following orders which may be applicable:\n                (a) that judgment be pronounced upon the offender;\n                (b) that a conviction be entered against the offender;\n                (c) that a venire de novo or new trial shall be had in such manner as the Court may direct;\n                (d) that the offender shall appear at such time and place as the Court may direct to receive judgment –\n        and any justice may thereupon issue his warrant for the arrest of the offender.\n        (6) Any offender so arrested may be admitted to bail by order of the Court or a judge.\n        (7) The Court may dismiss an appeal at any time, either on its own motion or on the application of either party to the appeal, if it is satisfied that –\n                (a) the appellant has failed to take all reasonable steps to prosecute the appeal; and\n                (b) it is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to do so.\n\n402A. Second or subsequent appeal by convicted person on fresh and compelling evidence\n        (1) In this section –\n            convicted person means a person who, before a court of trial, has been –\n                    (a) convicted of a serious crime; or\n                    (b) acquitted of a serious crime on the ground of insanity –\n            whether that conviction or acquittal occurred before or after the commencement of this section;\n            fresh and compelling evidence has the meaning given by subsection (10) ;\n            serious crime means a crime punishable upon indictment listed in Appendix D .\n        (2) The Court may hear a second or subsequent appeal by a convicted person if the person has been granted leave to appeal under this section.\n        (3) A convicted person may apply to a single judge for leave to lodge a second or subsequent appeal against the conviction on the ground that there is fresh and compelling evidence.\n        (4) At any time after receiving an application for leave to appeal under this section, the single judge may refer the matter to the Court for determination.\n        (5) On hearing the application of a convicted person for leave to appeal, the single judge or Court –\n                (a) must grant leave to appeal if satisfied that –\n                        (i) the convicted person has a reasonable case to present to the Court in support of the ground of the appeal; and\n                        (ii) it is in the interests of justice for the leave to be granted; or\n                (b) must refuse to grant leave to appeal if not so satisfied.\n        (6) The Court may uphold the second or subsequent appeal of a convicted person if satisfied that –\n                (a) there is fresh and compelling evidence; and\n                (b) after taking into account the fresh and compelling evidence, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice.\n        (7) The Court may dismiss the second or subsequent appeal of a convicted person if not satisfied as specified in subsection (6) .\n        (8) If the Court upholds the second or subsequent appeal of a convicted person, the Court may quash the conviction and either –\n                (a) direct that a judgement and verdict of acquittal be entered; or\n                (b) under section 404 , order that a new trial be held.\n        (9) If the Court orders under subsection (8)(b) that a new trial be held, the Court –\n                (a) may make such other orders as the Court thinks fit for the safe custody of the person who is to be retried or for admitting the person to bail; but\n                (b) may not make any other order directing the court that is to retry the person on the charge to convict or sentence the person.\n        (10) Evidence relating to the serious crime of which a convicted person was convicted –\n                (a) is fresh evidence if –\n                        (i) it was not adduced at the trial of the convicted person; and\n                        (ii) it could not, even with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been adduced at that trial; and\n                (b) is compelling evidence if –\n                        (i) it is reliable; and\n                        (ii) it is substantial; and\n                        (iii) in the context of the issues in dispute at the trial of the convicted person, it is highly probative of the case for the convicted person.\n        (11) Evidence that would be admissible on an appeal under this section is not precluded from being fresh and compelling evidence merely because it would have been inadmissible in the earlier trial of the convicted person for the serious crime of which he or she was convicted.\n        (12) Section 407 does not apply to an appeal, or an application for leave to appeal, under this section.\n\n403. Powers of Court in special cases\n        (1) If it appears to the Court that an appellant, though not properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment, the Court may either affirm the sentence passed at the trial or pass such sentence, whether more or less severe, in substitution therefor, as it thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law by the conviction on the indictment or part thereof on which it considers the appellant has been properly convicted.\n        (2) Where an appellant has been convicted of a crime, and the jury could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other crime, and on the finding of the jury it appears to the Court that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other crime, the Court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of that other crime, and pass such sentence, not being a sentence of greater severity, in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial, as may be warranted in law for that other crime.\n        (3) Where, on the conviction of the appellant, the jury have found a special verdict, and the Court considers that a wrong conclusion has been arrived at by the court of trial on the effect of that verdict, the Court may, instead of allowing the appeal, order such conclusion to be recorded as appears to the Court to be in law required by the verdict, and pass such sentence, whether more or less severe, in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial, as may be warranted in law.\n        (3A) Where under the foregoing provisions of this section the Court has power to affirm, or to pass a sentence in substitution for, a sentence passed on a person at his trial it may, instead of exercising that power, refer the case to the trial judge, and, on the case being so referred to him, that judge may himself exercise that power as if he were the Court; and any power exercised by a judge under this section has the like effect as if it were exercised by the Court.\n        (4) If on any appeal it appears to the Court that, although the appellant committed the act or made the omission charged against him, he was not of sound mind at the time when the act or omission alleged to constitute the crime occurred, so as not to be responsible therefor according to law, the Court may quash the sentence passed at the trial and exercise the like powers as could have been exercised if the appellant had been acquitted on the ground of insanity.\n\n404. Power to order new trial\n        (1) On any appeal the Court may, either of its own motion or on the application of the appellant, order a venire de novo or new trial at such time and place as it thinks fit, if the Court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and that, having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a venire de novo or new trial than by any other order which the Court is empowered to make.\n        (2) Where a venire de novo or new trial is directed, the Court may make such order as to it seems fit for the safe custody of the appellant or for admitting him to bail.\n\n405. Suspension of order, &c.: Revesting property on conviction\n        (1) The operation of any order for the restitution of any property, or for the payment of compensation to an aggrieved person, made by the court of trial, and the operation of the provisions of section 29 (1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1896 , as to the revesting of the property in stolen goods on conviction, shall (unless the court of trial directs to the contrary in any case in which in its opinion the title to the property is not in dispute) be suspended –\n                (a) until the expiration of the time provided for appealing to the Court; and\n                (b) where notice of appeal or of application for leave to appeal is given within the time provided, until the determination of the appeal or refusal of the application –\n        and in cases where the operation of any such order or the operation of the said provisions is suspended until the determination of the appeal, the order or provisions, as the case may be, shall not take effect as to the property in question if the conviction is quashed on appeal, except by the special order of the Court.\n        (2) The Court may, by order, annul or vary any order made on a trial for the restitution of any property to any person, although the conviction is not quashed; and such order, if annulled, shall not take effect, and, if varied, shall take effect as so varied.\n        (3) The judge of the court of trial may give directions for the safe custody of any such property pending the suspension of any such order or of such provisions.\n\n406. Jurisdiction in cases reserved\n    All questions reserved under section 387 shall be determined by the Court under the provisions of this chapter, and in any case in which an appellant appeals on any ground involving a question of law alone, the Court may direct that a case shall be stated and the appeal determined in the same manner as if a question of law had been reserved under the provisions of that section.\n\n407. Time for appealing\n        (1) Any person convicted desiring to appeal to the Court, or to obtain leave to appeal, against any conviction or sentence, shall give notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, within 14 days of the date of such conviction or sentence.\n        (1A) A notice under subsection (1) shall be signed by the person giving it or his attorney.\n        (2) . . . . . . . .\n        (3) An appeal by the Attorney-General under section 401(2)(a) , (b) , (d) and (e) is to be brought by the Attorney-General –\n                (a) notifying his or her intention to appeal at any time during the trial or immediately after the verdict in the presence of the accused or his or her counsel and, within 7 days after the conclusion of the trial, giving notice of appeal or of application for leave to appeal in the manner prescribed; or\n                (b) giving notice of appeal or of application for leave to appeal in the manner prescribed within 7 days after the conclusion of the trial.\n        (3A) An appeal by the Attorney-General under section 401(2)(c) is to be brought by the Attorney-General giving notice of appeal in the manner prescribed at any time within 14 days after sentence.\n        (4) Upon any such notification or notice as mentioned in subsection (3) or (3A) hereof, the judge of the court of trial may require the accused to enter into a recognizance, with or without sureties, to appear at such time and place as the judge may direct, or when called upon, to abide the determination of the appeal.\n        (4A) If the Attorney-General has not notified his or her intention to appeal or given a notice of appeal or a notice of application for leave to appeal under subsection (3) , then, if the relevant time has not expired, the Attorney-General may apply to the Court for an order requiring the accused to enter into a recognisance, with or without sureties, to appear before the Court at a specified time and place.\n        (4B) The Court must not make an order under subsection (4A) unless the Attorney-General gives an undertaking to give a notice of appeal or a notice of application for leave to appeal within the time specified in subsection (3) .\n        (4C) An order under subsection (4A) is to lapse and the accused is to be discharged from the recognisance if the Attorney-General has not given the relevant notice under subsection (3) within the time specified in that subsection.\n        (5) The time within which notice of appeal, or notice of an application for leave to appeal, may be given, may be extended at any time by the Court.\n\n407A.
