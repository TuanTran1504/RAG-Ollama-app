or\n                (b) in the case of the partial incapacity of the worker for work, weekly payments for the period of that incapacity equal to the difference between the worker's weekly payment calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) and the amount that the worker is earning or would be able to earn in suitable employment or business during that period of incapacity.\n        (2) For the purposes of this section, if the period of employment is 14 days or less, the normal weekly earnings of the worker before the commencement of the period of incapacity are to be taken to be –\n                (a) equivalent to the normal weekly earnings of another worker who is employed by the same employer and performing comparable work; or\n                (b) if there is no such other worker, the worker's expected weekly salary calculated on the hourly rate of pay for the work that he or she agreed, or was rostered, to perform in the pay period in which the incapacity occurred.\n        (2A) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) , the hourly rate of pay of a worker is –\n                (a) the rate to which the worker is entitled under the workers contract of employment or industrial instrument, for each of his or her hours of work, excluding overtime and shift or other allowances; or\n                (b) if a rate cannot be determined under the worker's contract of employment or industrial instrument, the rate for each of those hours as previously agreed between the worker and the employer.\n        (3) If, during the period of incapacity of a worker, the ordinary hourly rate of pay for the work in which, and for the hours during which, the worker was engaged immediately before the commencement of that period increases or decreases in accordance with the worker's entitlement under the worker's contract of employment or industrial instrument, the weekly payment to which the worker is entitled is to be increased or decreased by the like amount.\n        (4) The foregoing provisions of this section have effect subject to the following provisions of this subsection:\n                (a) in fixing the amount of the weekly payment to a worker under this section, regard shall be had to any payment, allowance, or benefit that the worker may receive in respect of his or her employment during the period of his or her incapacity, not being a payment, allowance, or benefit paid in respect of a period of long service leave or of any entitlement to long service leave or in lieu of the taking of a period of long service leave;\n                (b) when the question of the amount that a worker is earning or would be able to earn arises, if it appears to the Tribunal that, because of the injury that the worker has suffered (including the physical disfigurement of the worker) he is, or will be, unable to obtain employment or to remain in reasonably regular employment, the Tribunal may decide that the worker is incapacitated by the injury, either totally or partially and either permanently or temporarily, as the circumstances of the case require, and, on the Tribunal so deciding, compensation is payable to the worker in accordance with this Division;\n                (c) where a worker –\n                        (i) has so far recovered from an injury suffered by him as to be fit for employment (but only for employment of a more limited kind than the employment in which he was engaged before the date when he suffered the injury); and\n                        (ii) satisfies the Tribunal that he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain, and has failed to obtain, employment of a kind referred to in subparagraph (i) , and that his failure to obtain that employment is a consequence wholly or mainly of the injury (including the physical disfigurement) of the worker –\n                the Tribunal may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any earlier determination of the Tribunal under this Act, or any order, award, determination, or decision made by a judge under the repealed Act , in respect of that worker, determine that his incapacity shall continue to be treated as total incapacity for such period and subject to such conditions as the Tribunal thinks fit and, on the making of the determination, compensation is payable to the worker in accordance with this Division.\n                (d) . . . . . . . .\n        (5) In determining the amount of compensation payable under any of the foregoing provisions of this section, no regard shall be had to any sum paid or payable under any contract of assurance or insurance (including a contract made with a friendly society or other benefit society or association or a trade union) or out of any relief, superannuation, or sustentation fund, or other fund (whether statutory or otherwise) of the like nature.\n        (6) . . . . . . . .\n        (7) . . . . . . . .\n        (8) If of the opinion that an amount of weekly payments calculated in accordance with this section is insufficient or excessive, a worker, an employer or a licensed insurer of the employer may refer the matter to the Tribunal.\n        (9) The Tribunal, in relation to a matter referred to it under subsection (8) , is to determine the amount of weekly payments which appears to it to be reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, having regard to –\n                (a) the current weekly earnings of another worker of the same grade or classification as the worker and employed by the same employer in similar work to the worker; and\n                (b) the earnings that the worker might reasonably have earned during the period of incapacity; and\n                (c) any other relevant matter.\n        (10) In determining the amount of weekly payments under subsection (9) , the Tribunal shall have regard to the principle that a worker should not receive, during a period of incapacity, weekly payments greater than the payments the worker would have received if he had worked in his usual employment during that period.\n        (11) The amount of weekly payments determined by the Tribunal under subsection (9) shall be the amount of weekly payments payable to the worker notwithstanding that it may be a greater or lesser amount than the compensation otherwise payable under this section.\n        (12) Where the weekly payments determined by the Tribunal under subsection (9) involve a reduction in the amount of weekly payments being made to a worker, the Tribunal shall determine the date from which that reduction is to take effect, being a date that is not earlier than the date of the determination of the Tribunal.\n        (13) If the period specified in a medical certificate provided by a worker under this section expires and the worker provides a further certificate more than 14 days after the expiration of that specified period, the employer, on receipt of the subsequent certificate, may treat that certificate as a claim for compensation to which section 81A applies.\n        (14) In this section –\n            normal weekly earnings, in relation to a worker who is incapacitated for work, means the average weekly earnings of the worker during the relevant period;\n            relevant period means –\n                    (a) if the worker has been continuously employed by the same employer for 12 months or more, the 12 months immediately before the commencement of the period of incapacity; or\n                    (b) if the worker has been continuously employed by the same employer for less than 12 months, the period for which he or she was employed before the commencement of the period of incapacity.\n\n69A.

or\n                        (ii) 12 years from the date of the initial incapacity, if the worker's permanent impairment, assessed at a percentage of the whole person, is 15% or more but less than 20%; or\n                        (iii) 20 years from the date of the initial incapacity, if the worker's permanent impairment, assessed at a percentage of the whole person, is 20% or more but less than 30%; or\n                        (iv) the period extending from the date of the initial incapacity to the day on which the entitlement of the worker ceases in accordance with section 87 , if the worker's permanent impairment, assessed at a percentage of the whole person, is 30% or more.\n        (2) For the purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) , this subsection applies to a worker in respect of each week or part of a week, within the period referred to in those paragraphs, in respect of which –\n                (a) there is medical evidence that the worker is unable to perform the worker's usual duties with the employer;

or\n                (b) for which the worker was rostered to perform work in the pay period in which the worker's incapacity arose –\n        whichever is the higher.\n        (2D) In computing the normal weekly hours of the worker for the purposes of subsections (2B) and (2C) , any overtime or excess hours are to be disregarded unless –\n                (a) the overtime or excess hours were a requirement of the worker's contract of employment; and\n                (b) the worker worked overtime or excess hours in accordance with a regular and established pattern and in accordance with a roster; and\n                (c) the pattern was substantially uniform as to the number of overtime or excess hours worked; and\n                (d) the worker would have continued to work overtime or excess hours in accordance with the established pattern if the worker had not been incapacitated.\n        (2DA) Despite subsection (1) , a weekly payment in respect of a worker who is a police officer is not reduced by a percentage specified in subsection (1)(b) or (c) if, had the person not been a police officer, it is unlikely that the person would have been in the circumstances as a result of which the injury was suffered.\n        (2E) Subject to section 87 , a worker –\n                (a) to whom subsection (1)(c)(i) applies ceases to be entitled to weekly payments under section 69 on the expiration of 9 years after the date of the initial incapacity;

Nominal Insurer may be funded by contributions\n        (1) The Minister, after consulting with such interested parties as the Minister considers necessary or expedient, may determine that any liability of the Nominal Insurer under this Division is to be funded by –\n                (a) contributions from licensed insurers and self-insurers in such proportions as may be determined by the Nominal Insurer in a financial year having regard to –\n                        (i) in the case of licensed insurers, the premium income in respect of policies of insurance under this Act received by each licensed insurer in respect of that financial year; and\n                        (ii) in the case of self-insurers, the notional premium within the meaning of section 144(1) ; or\n                (b) a special contribution determined by the Minister payable by all policyholders and self-insurers; or\n                (c) a combination of the methods referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) .\n        (2) The Minister is to cause a notice of the making of a determination under subsection (1) to be published in the Gazette as soon as practicable after the determination is made.\n        (3) If the Minister determines that the Nominal Insurer's liability is to be funded, or partly funded, by contributions from licensed insurers and self-insurers, the amount required to be paid in respect of any financial year is not to exceed, for all acts of terrorism specified in orders under section 131B(1)(b) –\n                (a) in the case of licensed insurers, 4% of the premium income in respect of policies of insurance under this Act received by each licensed insurer in respect of that financial year; and\n                (b) in the case of self-insurers, 4% of the notional premium within the meaning of section 144(1) .\n        (4) If the Minister determines that any of the Nominal Insurer's liability is to be funded by contributions from licensed insurers or self-insurers, those contributions are not payable in respect of the financial year in which that determination is made.\n        (5) The Nominal Insurer may require contributions payable under subsection (1)(a) to be paid at such times, including in advance, and in such instalments as the Nominal Insurer determines.\n        (6) If contributions or a special contribution payable by a licensed insurer, self-insurer or policyholder under this section are not paid within the time specified by the Nominal Insurer or Minister, as the case may be –\n                (a) the licensed insurer, self-insurer or policyholder is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units; and\n                (b) the amount of those contributions or that special contribution together with interest calculated at the rate referred to in section 92(2)(b) may be recovered by the Nominal Insurer as a debt due to it in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n        (7) For the purposes of this section –\n                (a) each State Service Agency is taken to be a policyholder; and\n                (b) the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund is taken to be a licensed insurer.\n        (8) If the Nominal Insurer is, or is likely to be, liable to pay a claim under this Division in respect of an act of terrorism specified in an order under section 131B(1)(b) , the Nominal Insurer is to establish a separate account in the Nominal Insurer Fund into which money received by the Nominal Insurer by way of payments under this section, in respect of that act of terrorism, is to be paid.\n        (9) The Nominal Insurer is to pay from that separate account –\n                (a) any amount required to be paid for claims under section 131C ; and\n                (b) any amount required to pay costs and expenses incurred by the Nominal Insurer in, or in connection with, the performance of its functions under this Division; and\n                (c) any amount required to repay money borrowed by the Nominal Insurer under section 129A , inclusive of any interest, or to pay costs associated with any other arrangements entered into by the Nominal Insurer for the payment of amounts referred to in paragraph (a) .\n\nPART X - Concurrent rights to compensation and damages\n\nDivision 1 - Rights to compensation and damages\n\n132. Interpretation of Part X\n    In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears –\n        compensation, used in relation to an injury, means any compensation or any such expenses as are referred to in section 75 payable in respect of that injury under this Act;\n        damages means damages recoverable (whether by virtue of an enactment or otherwise) in respect of any civil liability in the employer, however arising;\n        employer, used in relation to an injury suffered by a worker, includes any person who, in respect of that injury, is liable, under section 29 , to pay compensation or to indemnify any other person for any compensation paid by that other person.\n\n132A. Settlement by agreement\n        (1) A worker's outstanding entitlements to compensation under this Act in respect of an injury may only be settled by an agreement to settle by which the worker agrees that all further claims to compensation are extinguished.\n        (2) An agreement to settle that does not comply with this section is void.\n        (3) A settlement by agreement of all a worker's outstanding entitlements to compensation may only be entered into, before the end of the period of 2 years beginning on the day on which a claim for compensation is first made in relation to the worker, if the agreement has been approved by the Tribunal under this section.\n        (4) A worker, the employer or the employer's insurer may, in a form approved by the Tribunal, refer to the Tribunal for its approval a proposed agreement to settle, which may be in the form the parties think fit.\n        (5) The Tribunal may approve, or refuse to approve, a proposed agreement to settle that is referred to it under subsection (4) .\n        (6) The Tribunal may only approve under subsection (5) a proposed agreement to settle –\n                (a) if the Tribunal is satisfied that –\n                        (i) all reasonable steps have been taken to enable the worker to whom the proposed agreement relates to be rehabilitated or retrained or to return to work; or\n                        (ii) the worker has returned to work; or\n                (b) where the Tribunal has, on a reference to the Tribunal under section 81A , determined that there is a reasonably arguable case for disputing liability to pay compensation under this Act, if the Tribunal is satisfied that the proposed agreement is in the best interests of the worker; or\n                (c) if the Tribunal is satisfied that –\n                        (i) special circumstances in relation to the worker make the worker's rehabilitation, retraining or return to work impracticable; and\n                        (ii) the proposed agreement is in the best interests of the worker.\n        (7) The Tribunal may only approve under subsection (5) a proposed agreement to settle if the Tribunal is satisfied that –\n                (a) the worker has received advice (which may be legal or financial advice or both) about the implications of settling the claim, which advice has been paid by the employer or the employer's insurer and is appropriate in the circumstances of the worker;

and\n                (b) a party to the claim may refer to the Tribunal under subsection (4) another proposed agreement to settle.\n        (9) If a worker's outstanding entitlements to compensation are settled by agreement between the parties after the end of the period of 2 years beginning on the day on which a claim for compensation is first made in relation to the worker, the worker, the employer or the employer's insurer may refer the agreement to settle to the Tribunal for review.\n        (10) A referral under subsection (9) of an agreement to settle –\n                (a) must be made within 3 months of the date of the agreement; and\n                (b) is to be in a form approved by the Tribunal.\n        (11) The Tribunal may set aside an agreement to settle referred to the Tribunal under subsection (9) if the Tribunal is of the opinion that –\n                (a) a party entered the agreement under duress; or\n                (b) the worker has not received advice (which may be legal or financial advice, or both) about the implications of settling the claim, which advice has been paid by the employer or the employer's insurer and is appropriate in the circumstances of the worker;

and\n                (b) the Tribunal is satisfied the referral was frivolous or vexatious.\n\n133. Effect of compensation on worker's right to damages\n        (1) Except as otherwise provided in this Part, the payment or an entitlement to the payment of compensation in respect of an injury does not affect the right to obtain damages in respect of that injury, but, where a liability has been incurred (whether by the employer or any other person) for the payment of damages to a worker in respect of an injury, the payment to or to the benefit of that worker of compensation in respect of that injury shall, so far as it extends, be regarded also as a payment in or towards the discharge of that liability, and the amount of the damages shall be reduced accordingly.\n        (2) The subsistence of a right of a worker or a dependant of a deceased worker to damages in respect of an injury, or the taking of proceedings to establish any such right or for the recovery of any such damages, does not prejudice or affect his right to compensation in respect of that injury, but where a worker or a dependant of a deceased worker has obtained judgment (whether against his employer or any other person) for damages in respect of an injury or has accepted any money paid into court in satisfaction of a claim for damages, his right to any payments by way of compensation that have not been determined before the date of the judgment, or the date of his acceptance of money paid into court, is extinguished.\n        (3) The settlement by a worker or a dependant of a deceased worker of a claim for damages in respect of an injury, if by that settlement he agrees that all his further claims to compensation in respect of that injury are extinguished, has, for the purposes of subsection (2) , the like effect as a judgment obtained by that worker or that dependant for those damages.\n\n134. Right of employer to contribution or indemnity from third parties\n        (1) Subject to this section, where an injury for which compensation is payable to a worker is caused under circumstances which, but for section 138AB , would create a liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect of that injury to that worker, the employer may recover indemnity against that person in respect of the compensation paid by the employer to the worker in respect of that injury.\n        (2) Subject to subsection (3) , where the circumstances referred to in subsection (1) create the liability to pay damages both in the employer and some other person, whether arising as a result of a tort or otherwise, the employer has the like right of indemnity or contribution against that other person in respect of the compensation paid by the employer as if that compensation were part of those damages.\n        (3) Where an injury to a worker arises partly by his or her own fault and partly by the fault of another person, the amount recoverable by the employer under this section by way of contribution or indemnity is reduced to such extent as the Supreme Court thinks just and equitable having regard to the degree of the worker's responsibility for the injury.\n\n135.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n136. Application to bring action on\n        (1) Where a worker has accepted the payment of compensation in respect of an injury, the employer may, not sooner than 12 months after the date on which the worker first received payment of compensation in respect of that injury, serve on the worker a notice in writing requiring the worker, not later than 42 days after service of the notice, to commence proceedings against the employer to recover damages in respect of that injury and, if the worker within that period does not commence those proceedings, the employer may apply to the Supreme Court or a judge in chambers for an order that the worker commence proceedings within whatever period that the Court or judge may direct.\n        (2) Upon hearing an application under subsection (1) , the Supreme Court or judge in chambers may make an order –\n                (a) fixing a time within which proceedings to recover damages shall be commenced by the worker; or\n                (b) adjourning the application –\n                        (i) for a fixed period, or indefinitely (with liberty to the employer to apply); and\n                        (ii) on such terms and conditions as the Court or judge thinks fit –\n        and may make any other order and give other directions.\n        (3) Where, before the end of the time fixed by the Supreme Court or a judge in chambers in accordance with subsection (2) (a) , the worker files an application for an extension of that time, the Supreme Court or judge may order an extension.\n        (4) Upon the hearing of an application adjourned pursuant to subsection (2) (b) , the Supreme Court or a judge in chambers may make any order under subsection (2) in relation to that application.\n        (5) Where a worker does not commence proceedings against an employer to recover damages in respect of an injury, within –\n                (a) a time fixed by the Supreme Court or a judge in chambers in accordance with subsection (2) (a) ; or\n                (b) any extension of that time granted under subsection (3) –\n        any right of action of the worker to recover damages in respect of that injury is, without affecting his right to compensation under this Act, forever barred and extinguished.\n\n137. Weekly payments to be continued during proceedings for damages\n    Subject to section 89 , where a worker who is entitled under this Act to weekly payments during his incapacity takes proceedings independently of this Act for damages for the injury in respect of which he is entitled to receive those weekly payments, his employer shall, pending the determination of those proceedings, pay or, as the case requires, continue to pay to the worker all such weekly payments to which the worker is so entitled as if those proceedings had not been taken.\n\n138. Proceedings by dependants to be taken jointly\n    Where the dependants of a worker are entitled to compensation in respect of an injury resulting in his death, proceedings in respect of that compensation or for the payment of damages in respect of that injury shall, except with the leave of the Tribunal, be brought jointly by all those dependants.\n\nDivision 2 - Restrictions on awards of damages\n\n138AA. Application of Division\n        (1) This Division applies to the awarding of damages against an employer independently of this Act in respect of an injury suffered by a worker if –\n                (a) the injury was caused by the negligence or other tort of, or a breach of contract or statutory duty by, an employer; and\n                (b) compensation has been paid or is payable in respect of the injury under this Act or would have been paid or be payable but for section 25(2) .\n        (2) This Division applies even if the damages resulting from the negligence or other tort of an employer are sought to be recovered in an action for breach of contract or statutory duty or other action.\n        (3) A reference in this Division to an employer includes a reference to a person for whose acts an employer is vicariously liable.\n        (4) This Division extends to an employer's liability for a breach of statutory duty by a worker where the employer would have been liable for damages if the employer had committed the breach.\n        (5) This Division does not apply to an action by a worker for damages for trespass, or any other cause of action for which the employer is not vicariously liable, committed against the worker by a person –\n                (a) employed by the employer under a contract of service at the time the injury was suffered; or\n                (b) otherwise deemed to be a worker employed by the employer at that time.\n\n138AB. Claims for damages\n        (1) A settlement by agreement of a claim for damages in respect of an injury to a worker for which compensation is payable under this Act is void unless the threshold requirement is met in relation to the injury.\n        (2) A person may not commence proceedings for an award of damages in respect of an injury to a worker for which compensation is payable under this Act, unless the threshold requirement is met in relation to the injury.\n        (3) The threshold requirement is met in relation to an injury if –\n                (a) there has been provided to the Tribunal a statement in writing, signed by a medical practitioner, certifying that, in the opinion of the practitioner, the degree of permanent impairment of the worker resulting from the injury is not less than 20% of the whole person; and\n                (b) the Tribunal has determined that the degree of permanent impairment of the worker resulting from the injury is not less than 20% of the whole person.\n        (4) The threshold requirement is met in relation to an injury suffered by a worker if –\n                (a) the injury is an injury to which section 71(3) applies; and\n                (b) there has been provided to the Tribunal a statement in writing, signed by a medical practitioner, certifying that the injury is an injury to which section 71(3) applies.\n        (5) An assessment of the degree of the worker's permanent impairment for the purposes of this section is to be carried out in accordance with section 72 or 73 .\n        (6) The Tribunal may refer the question of the degree of permanent impairment to a medical panel in accordance with Part V .\n        (7) The Tribunal is to keep a record of –\n                (a) a statement provided to the Tribunal in accordance with subsection (3)(a) ; and\n                (b) a determination of the Tribunal of the kind referred to in subsection (3)(b) ; and\n                (c) a statement provided to the Tribunal in accordance with subsection (4)(b) ; and\n                (d) any other prescribed matter.\n\n138ABA.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n138AC.\n. . . . . . . .\n\n138AD.
