Advance care directives from other jurisdictions\n        (1) In this section –\n            corresponding law means a law that is declared to be a corresponding law under subsection (2) ;\n            interstate advance care directive means an instrument, containing future health care decisions, made by a person in another State, or in a Territory or another country.\n        (2) Where it appears to the Minister that a law in force in another State, or in a Territory or country has substantially the same effect as Part 5A of this Act, the Minister may by notice published in the Gazette declare that the law is a corresponding law for the purpose of this section.\n        (3) Subject to this section, if an interstate advance care directive is made under a corresponding law and that directive complies with that corresponding law, that interstate advance care directive is taken to be an advance care directive given in accordance with this Part.\n        (4) An interstate advance care directive that is taken to be an advance care directive under subsection (3) is valid only to the extent that it would be valid if it were an advance care directive given in accordance with this Part.\n        (5) For the purposes of this section, a certificate, from an Australian legal practitioner or from the Registrar of a relevant Court, or Board, that the interstate advance care directive satisfies the requirements of the relevant corresponding law is evidence of that fact.\n        (6) If an interstate advance care directive is not recognised, whether wholly or partly, as valid for the purposes of this Part, the advance care directive may nevertheless be taken into consideration under this Part as an expression of a person's preferences and values.\n        (7) A notice under subsection (2) is not a statutory rule for the purposes of the Rules Publication Act 1953.\n\n35ZO. Advance care directive does not authorise appointment of power of attorney or enduring guardian\n    Nothing in this Act authorises an advance care directive to have the effect of authorising the appointment of a power of attorney or an enduring guardian.\n\n35ZP.
