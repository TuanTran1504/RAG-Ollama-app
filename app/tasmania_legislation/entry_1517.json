  "text": "Proclamation under the Nature Conservation Act 2002\n\nI, the Governor in and over the State of Tasmania and its Dependencies in the Commonwealth of Australia, acting with the advice of the Executive Council, by this my proclamation made under section 21 of the Nature Conservation Act 2002 declare that â€“\n\n        (a) the area of private land specified in Schedule 1 to this proclamation, being an area of land within land at Bell Bay reserved in the class of conservation area*, ceases to form part of that reserved land; and\n        (b) this proclamation takes effect on the day on which its making is notified in the Gazette.\n        *Note: The land at Bell Bay was declared to be a sanctuary under the Animals and Birds Protection Act 1928 by a proclamation notified in the Gazette as Statutory Rules 1958, No. 154. On the commencement of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970, the land became a conservation area under that Act. In 1991, the land was vested in Hydro Tasmania, a public authority within the meaning of that Act. By operation of section 18 of the Regional Forest Agreement (Land Classification) Act 1998, the land was taken to have been declared to be reserved land in the class of conservation area under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970. On the commencement of the Nature Conservation Act 2002, the land was taken to be reserved land in the class of conservation area under that Act. Despite the subsequent transfer of the land to Bell Bay Power Pty Ltd in 2003, the land remained a conservation area by virtue of section 13(6) of the Nature Conservation Act 2002.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        \n    25 June 2007\n\n    W.
