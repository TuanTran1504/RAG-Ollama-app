Instruments executed and intestacies which take place before the commencement of this Act\n        (1) All instruments executed before the commencement of this Act shall be governed by the enactments, rules of construction, and law which would have applied to them if this Act had not been passed.\n        (2) Where an instrument to which subsection (1) applies creates a special power of appointment nothing in this Act shall extend the class of persons in whose favour the appointment may be made or cause the exercise of the power to be construed so as to include any person who was not at the time of the creation of the instrument a member of that class.\n        (3) The estate of a person who dies intestate as to the whole or any part of his estate before the commencement of this Act shall be distributed in accordance with the enactments and rules of law which would have applied to the estate if this Act had not been passed.\n\nPART II - Presumptions of parenthood and recognition of paternity\n\n5. Presumption of parentage arising from marriage\n        (1) A child who is born to a woman while she is married is presumed to be the child of the woman and her spouse.\n        (2) If –\n                (a) at a particular time –\n                        (i) a marriage to which a woman is a party is ended by death; or\n                        (ii) a purported marriage to which a woman is a party is annulled; and\n                (b) a child is born to the woman within 44 weeks after that time –\n        the child is presumed to be the child of the woman and her deceased spouse or purported spouse.\n        (3) If –\n                (a) the parties to a marriage separate at any time; and\n                (b) after the separation they resumed cohabitation on at least one occasion; and\n                (c) within 3 months after resuming cohabitation they separated again and lived separately and apart; and\n                (d) a child is born to the woman within 44 weeks after the cohabitation ends but after the dissolution of the marriage –\n        the child is presumed to be the child of the woman and the former spouse.\n\n6.
