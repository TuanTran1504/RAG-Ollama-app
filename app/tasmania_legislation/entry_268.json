Determination of application for declaration where alternative remedy of compensation applied for\n        (1) Subsection (2) applies to an application under section 10 to the Supreme Court for a declaration made by a supplier in respect of a contravention, or a proposed contravention, in relation to a covered procurement, if –\n                (a) the supplier has made an application for an order under section 14 in relation to the contravention or proposed contravention; and\n                (b) there is a public interest certificate in relation to the procurement; and\n                (c) the procurement has not reached the stage where a contract, or other arrangement, in relation to the covered procurement has been entered into with a supplier.\n        (2) If this subsection applies to an application in respect of a contravention, or a proposed contravention, in relation to a covered procurement, the Supreme Court must consider –\n                (a) whether the issue of the declaration, or the grant of an interlocutory or interim injunction, would result in a significant delay to the covered procurement; and\n                (b) if so, whether the making of an order under section 14(1) in relation to the contravention would be a more appropriate remedy for the contravention, or proposed contravention, than the issue of the declaration.\n        (3) If the Supreme Court, after considering under subsection (2) whether the making of an order under section 14(1) in relation to the contravention, or proposed contravention, in respect of which an application under that section is made would be a more appropriate remedy for the contravention or proposed contravention than the issue of the declaration to which the application relates, is satisfied that –\n                (a) the issue of the declaration, or the grant of an interlocutory or interim injunction, would result in a significant delay to the procurement to which the contravention, or proposed contravention, relates; and\n                (b) the making of an order under section 14(1) in relation to the contravention would be a more appropriate remedy for the contravention, or proposed contravention, than the issue of the declaration –\n        the Supreme Court may refuse to issue the declaration or to grant an interlocutory or interim injunction.\n        (4) Nothing in this section is to be taken to limit the power of the Supreme Court to issue a declaration or the grant of an interlocutory or interim injunction.\n\n13. Certain limitations on issue or grant of declarations or injunctions not to apply\n        (1) The power of the Supreme Court to issue a declaration or to grant an interlocutory or interim injunction under section 10 in relation to a contravention, or a proposed contravention, of an enforceable procurement provision may be exercised –\n                (a) if the Court is satisfied, to the degree that is applicable to the making of a declaration or an interlocutory or interim injunction, as the case may be, that the agency has engaged in conduct of a kind that constitutes, or may constitute, the contravention or proposed contravention – whether or not it appears to the Court that the agency intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; or\n                (b) if it appears to the Court that, if a declaration is not issued or an interlocutory or interim injunction is not granted, it is likely that the agency will engage in conduct of that kind –\n                        (i) whether or not the agency has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and\n                        (ii) whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the agency engages in conduct of that kind.\n        (2) The power of the Supreme Court to issue a declaration under section 10 in relation to conduct that constitutes, or may constitute, a contravention or proposed contravention of an enforceable procurement provision may be exercised –\n                (a) if the Court is satisfied that the agency has refused or failed to do an act or thing – whether or not it appears to the Court that the agency intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do that act or thing; or\n                (b) if it appears to the Court that, if a declaration is not issued, it is likely that the agency will refuse or fail to do that act or thing –\n                        (i) whether or not the agency has previously refused or failed to do that act or thing; and\n                        (ii) whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the agency refuses or fails to do that act or thing.\n\n14.

Public interest certificate\n    A relevant government agency may issue a written certificate stating that it is not in the public interest for a procurement specified in the certificate to be suspended while –\n            (a) an application for a declaration under section 10 is being considered; or\n            (b) a complaint under section 7 is being investigated.\n\n16. Other powers of Supreme Court unaffected\n    The powers conferred on the Supreme Court under this Act are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other powers of the Court to grant relief to a party in proceeding before it otherwise than under this Act.\n\n17. Contravention of enforceable procurement provision does not affect validity of contract\n        (1) A contravention of an enforceable procurement provision does not affect the validity of a contract.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) , it is immaterial whether the contravention occurred before, at or after the commencement of this Act.\n\n18. Transitional\n    This Act, apart from section 17 , does not apply to a contravention of an enforceable procurement provision that occurred before the commencement of this Act.\n\n19. Regulations\n        (1) The Governor may make regulations for the purposes of this Act.\n        (2) The regulations may be made so as to apply differently according to matters, limitations or restrictions, whether as to time, circumstance or otherwise, specified in the regulations.\n        (3) The regulations may authorise any matter to be from time to time determined, applied or regulated by any person or body specified in the regulations.\n\n20.
