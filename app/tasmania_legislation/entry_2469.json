What discussions have I had with residents of the retirement village I have chosen?  Will the lifestyle of the village (including social activities and religion) suit me?  What are the rules with regard to having someone else live with me?  What system does the village have for resolving disputes?  Are the residents actively involved in making village rules?    Legal Implications  Have I sought advice on the documents relating to the village from an Australian legal practitioner, Tasmania Legal Aid or some other appropriate source?  Under what conditions can I be moved from my place of residence to another part of the village?  How can the operator terminate my occupation?  Is my long-term occupation at the village secure?  What protection do I have if the village is sold to some other organisation?    Financial Matters  Am I aware of, and can I afford to pay, the ingoing contribution (if applicable), the regular recurrent charges and any extraordinary charges which can be imposed on me?  What arrangements can be made if I can't meet future charges?  How do the terms and amount of repayment of my ingoing contribution compare with other villages?  When do I get access to my money after I leave the village?  Are the residents actively involved in decisions concerning the level of maintenance and services provided, their cost, and how these costs are to be varied in the future?  What are the restrictions on the sale of my residential premises?  What say do I have in deciding the sale price?    Building and Construction  Have the community facilities of the village been built? If not, what guarantee do I have that they will ever be constructed?  Do I have any say in the design, construction and furnishing of my residential premises if construction is not yet complete?  Will the residential premises, building and site be accessible if I become disabled and need a wheelchair or walking aid? If not, can modifications be made easily?    Health and Welfare  What services specially designed for the elderly does the village provide, e.g. nursing care, access to nursing care, an emergency call system? Do these services meet my present needs and what I expect will be my future needs?  What financial and accommodation alternatives do I have if I become too frail to live in these residential premises?    Activities and Amenities  What are the restrictions on the use of my residential premises and the village facilities?  How will I have to adapt and alter my existing lifestyle to comply with the regulations and restrictions of life in the village?  What type of public, private or village transport is available?  Are pets permitted?  How accessible are the local shops to my present and future needs?\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n"
