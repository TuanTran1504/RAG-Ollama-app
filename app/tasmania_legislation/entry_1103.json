Restrictions on subsequent abandoned land notice\n    Where an objection has been made to the registration of an abandoned land notice with respect to any land and is not withdrawn and that abandoned land notice is not subsequently registered in respect of that land no further abandoned land notice shall be published in respect of that land until after the expiration of a period of 6 years from the date of the certificate issued by the Director under section 7 (7) in respect of the abandoned land notice.\n\n14. Saving for certain rights to resume land\n    Nothing in this Act affects any right of the Crown to resume land by virtue of a right reserved in the grant thereof or under any other Act, but the existence of any such right in respect of any land does not prevent the exercise in relation to that land of any of the powers conferred by this Act.\n\n15. Expenses of Act\n    The expenses incurred in the administration of this Act (including the payment of any compensation thereunder) shall be defrayed out of money provided by Parliament for the purpose.\n\n16.
