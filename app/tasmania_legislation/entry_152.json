Restrictions on admission of evidence of breath analyses\n        Evidence of the concentration of alcohol in the breath of a person as determined by a breath analysing instrument is not admissible in any proceedings unless –\n                (a) such a statement as is referred to in section 29(1) was read over to the person, and handed to the person, on completion of the analysis; and\n                (b) if the person made such a request as is referred to in section 29(2) –\n                        (i) a sample of the person's blood was taken by a medical practitioner or nurse in accordance with this Act and that blood-sampling began within 3 hours after the relevant time; or\n                        (ii) the person refused to submit to a blood-sampling after appropriate arrangements had been made under that section in response to the request.\n\n    52. Evidence as to carrying out breath analyses\n        If, in any proceedings, a person gives evidence –\n                (a) that at a specified time and place he or she carried out a breath analysis of a person by means of a breath analysing instrument; and\n                (b) that, at that specified time, the person giving the evidence was an approved operator; and\n                (c) that, at that specified time, the instrument was in proper working order –\n        that evidence is prima facie evidence of the particulars so stated and of the fact that, when the analysis was carried out, the instrument was in proper working order.\n\n    53. Evidence of matters related to failure to submit to breath analysis\n        If, in any proceedings, a person gives evidence –\n                (a) that at a specified time and place a named person failed to submit to a breath analysis; and\n                (b) that at that time and place a breath analysis could have been properly carried out by the person giving evidence by means of a breath analysing instrument that he or she then had with him or her; and\n                (c) that at that time a breath analysing instrument was in proper working order; and\n                (d) that at that time the person giving the evidence was an approved operator –\n        that evidence is prima facie evidence of the particulars so stated.\n\n    54.

Avoidance of certain provisions in insurance contracts\n        A provision of a contract or other agreement is void to the extent that it purports to exclude or limit the liability of an insurer under a contract of insurance in the event of a vessel owner or vessel operator –\n                (a) being convicted of an offence under this Act; or\n                (b) having alcohol in his or her breath or blood, or more than a specified concentration of alcohol in his or her breath or blood, as indicated by breath test, breath analysis or blood-sampling under this Act.\n\n    60.
