Limit on power to arrest\n    A police officer may only arrest a youth in relation to an offence if the arresting officer believes the offence is serious enough to warrant an arrest and also believes, on reasonable grounds, that –\n            (a) the arrest is necessary to prevent a continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence that, if it were committed by the youth, would be sufficiently serious to warrant the youth being arrested in relation to the commission of that offence; or\n            (b) the arrest is necessary to facilitate the making of a police family violence order, within the meaning of the Family Violence Act 2004 , an application for a family violence order under that Act or an application for a restraint order under Part XA of the Justices Act 1959 ; or\n            (c) the arrest is necessary to prevent concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence; or\n            (d) the youth is unlikely to appear before the Court in response to a complaint and summons.\n\n24A.

Conditions of bail\n    A court or justice, or a police officer, who intends to admit a youth to bail must have regard to the principles set out in section 5 , so far as they may apply to the circumstances of the youth, in deciding whether to impose any conditions on the bail and in determining the conditions that are imposed on the bail.\n\n24C.

Application and interpretation of certain sentence provisions\n        (1) If, in this or any other Act, a penalty including imprisonment is specified in respect of an offence against this or any other Act and a youth is found guilty of the offence, that reference to imprisonment is taken to be a reference to detention.\n        (2) When determining a sentence, the Court –\n                (a) must disregard a requirement under any other Act that an amount of money or term of imprisonment must be the minimum penalty for the offence; and\n                (b) must regard a requirement under any other Act that an amount of money or term of imprisonment, or both, must be the only penalty for the offence as providing instead that the amount or term, or both, are the maximum penalties for the offence; and\n                (c) must comply with a requirement under any other Act that a loss of a licence or other penalty, other than an amount of money or term of imprisonment, must be imposed as a penalty for the offence.\n        (3) A requirement under this or any other Act that an amount of money or term of imprisonment, or both, are the only penalties for an offence does not prevent the Court from making any order it considers appropriate under section 47(1) or (2) instead of, or in addition to, those penalties.\n\n47.

Court may impose single, general or mixed sentence\n        (1) If a youth has been found guilty of more than one offence specified in one or more complaints, the Court may impose on the youth –\n                (a) one sentence for all of those offences; or\n                (b) a separate sentence for each of those offences; or\n                (c) one sentence for a group of those offences determined by the Court and –\n                        (i) one sentence for all of the remaining offences; or\n                        (ii) a separate sentence for each of the remaining offences; or\n                        (iii) a separate sentence for each other group of the offences remaining as the court determines and a separate sentence for each offence remaining, if any, as is not within any such group.\n        (2) In imposing a single sentence on a youth for more than one offence, the Court must not impose a penalty exceeding the sum of the maximum penalties that could otherwise have been imposed under this Part if each of those offences had been sentenced separately.\n\n50. Youth entitled to explanation of Court order\n        (1) On imposing a sentence under section 47 , the Court must take steps to ensure that the youth and the guardian, if present, understand –\n                (a) the purpose and effect of the order; and\n                (b) the consequences (if any) that may follow if the youth fails to comply with the requirements of the order.\n        (2) The steps the Court may take under subsection (1) may include –\n                (a) directly explaining the matters in the Court; or\n                (b) having some appropriate person give the explanation; or\n                (c) having an interpreter, or other person able to communicate effectively with the youth and the guardian, give the explanation; or\n                (d) causing an explanatory note in English or another language to be supplied to the youth and the guardian.\n\nDivision 6 - Undertakings to be of good behaviour\n\n51.

Period of detention\n    A period of detention –\n            (a) must not be imposed if an adult who committed the same offence could not be sentenced to imprisonment; and\n            (b) must not exceed 2 years.\n\n82. Warrant for detention\n        (1) On making a detention order against a youth, the Court must issue a warrant –\n                (a) directing the Secretary, a police officer or another person to take the youth into custody; and\n                (b) requiring that the youth be delivered to a detention centre.\n        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Court on making a detention order against a youth also makes a suspended detention order in respect of the whole period of detention.\n\n83. Commencement of detention\n        (1) A period of detention commences on the day the Court makes the detention order except where –\n                (a) the Court makes an order under section 85(1) ; or\n                (b) the youth has been held in custody pending the determination of proceedings for an offence; or\n                (c) the order specifies otherwise.\n        (2) If the Court makes an order under section 85(1) , the period of detention commences on the earliest release date or next release date in respect of any other period of detention that is relevant under that section.\n        (3) On and from the commencement of a period of detention served in a detention centre until the youth is released under the supervised release order, the youth is taken to be in the custody of the Secretary.\n\n84. Detention orders ordinarily concurrent\n    If, at the time the Court makes a detention order against a youth for an offence, the youth is serving or has been sentenced to serve a period of detention for another offence, the period of detention under the detention order must be served concurrently with the other period of detention, unless other provision is made under section 85 or another Act.\n\n85. Court may order detention period to be cumulative\n        (1) If, at the time the Court makes a detention order against a youth for an offence, the youth is serving or has been sentenced to serve a period of detention for another offence, the Court may order the period of detention under the detention order to take effect on the earliest release date or next release date in respect of that other period of detention.\n        (2) Subsection (1) applies even if the other period of detention has to be served concurrently or cumulatively with a period of detention for an offence other than the one for which the Court makes the detention order.\n\n86. Limitation on cumulative orders\n        (1) If the Court makes an order under section 85(1) , the total time that a youth, at the time of making that order, can be required to be detained in a detention centre must not exceed 2 years.\n        (2) If the Court makes an order under section 85(1) requiring a period of detention to take effect on the earliest release date or next release date in respect of another period of detention, any time for which the youth has been detained in respect of that other period of detention before the order under that section is made is not to be counted for the purposes of calculating the total time that a youth can be detained.\n        (3) To the extent that the total time to be spent in detention under 2 or more detention orders by reason of an order under section 85(1) exceeds the maximum allowed, the orders are of no effect.\n\n87.

Multiple orders of detention and imprisonment against person as adult and youth\n        (1) Sections 84 , 85 , 86 and 87 extend to a case where at the time the Court makes a detention order against a youth, the youth is serving or has been sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment in a prison as if a reference in those sections to a period of detention included a reference to the term of imprisonment.\n        (2) If a youth is liable to serve a term of imprisonment in a prison concurrently with a period of detention –\n                (a) the period must be served as a term of imprisonment in a prison; and\n                (b) the period of deprivation of liberty under the term of imprisonment must be counted as part of the period of detention; and\n                (c) any period of deprivation of liberty served in the detention centre –\n                        (i) is a period of detention served; and\n                        (ii) must be counted as part of the term of imprisonment in the prison.\n\n89. Period of custody on remand to be treated as detention on sentence\n        (1) In this section, a reference to a period of custody includes a reference to part of a period of custody.\n        (2) In making a detention order in relation to an offence or a group of offences (the relevant detention order), the Court must take into account any period during which the youth was held in custody on remand in relation to proceedings for, or arising from, that offence or group of offences unless that period has been taken into account by the Court, or another court, in relation to the making of another detention order or the imposition of a term of imprisonment under the Sentencing Act 1997 .\n        (3) If in making a relevant detention order the Court takes into account a period of custody referred to in subsection (2) , the Court must order that the period of detention under the relevant detention order is to commence on a day earlier than the day on which it is imposed, being such day as the Court considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n89A.
