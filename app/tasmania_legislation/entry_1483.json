Non-disclosure of information\n    Despite section 119 , the Supreme Court is not to include information in a wealth-restraining order, if the Court is satisfied that the release of the information may materially prejudice an ongoing investigation by the DPP.\n\n121. Scope of wealth-restraining orders\n    As part of proceedings for a wealth-restraining order, the Supreme Court may do any one or more of the following in respect of property that is affected by the wealth-restraining order:\n            (a) if the property is moveable, direct that the property is not to be moved except in accordance with the wealth-restraining order;\n            (b) appoint the Public Trustee or another person to manage the property while the wealth-restraining order is in force;\n            (c) give any directions necessary to provide for the security and management of the property while the wealth-restraining order is in force;\n            (d) provide for the reasonable living and business expenses of the owner of the property to be met while the wealth-restraining order is in force.\n\n122. Service of wealth-restraining orders\n        (1) As soon as practicable after a wealth-restraining order is made, the DPP must arrange for a copy of the wealth-restraining order and a notice that complies with subsection (2) to be served personally on each of the following persons:\n                (a) the person named in the wealth-restraining order;\n                (b) if, under the authority of the wealth-restraining order, property is, or has been, taken from a person or is in the custody of a person, that person;\n                (c) any person known to the DPP at the time the wealth-restraining order was made who has, may have or claims to have an interest in property affected by the wealth-restraining order.\n        (2) The notice referred to in subsection (1) must –\n                (a) summarise the effect of the wealth-restraining order, including the period for which it applies; and\n                (b) advise the person on whom the wealth-restraining order and the notice are served –\n                        (i) that the property affected by the wealth-restraining order may be forfeited under this Part; and\n                        (ii) that, within 28 days after being served with the copy of the wealth-restraining order, the person may file in the Supreme Court an objection to the restraint of the property; and\n                        (iii) that the person is required to make and lodge a statutory declaration in accordance with section 123 .\n        (3) If, as a result of a statutory declaration made in accordance with section 123 , the DPP becomes aware of another person who has, may have or claims to have an interest in the property affected by the wealth-restraining order, the DPP must arrange for personal service of a copy of the wealth-restraining order and notice, in accordance with subsection (2) , on that other person as soon as practicable.\n        (4) Subsections (1) and (3) do not prevent the DPP from serving, at any time, a copy of the wealth-restraining order and a notice on any other person of whom the DPP becomes aware who has, may have or claims to have an interest in the property.\n        (5) The DPP must ensure that –\n                (a) an affidavit of service is endorsed on a copy of each copy of the wealth-restraining order that is served; and\n                (b) each endorsed copy is filed in the registry of the Supreme Court.\n\n123. Statutory declaration required from persons served with wealth-restraining orders\n        (1) A person who is served under section 122(1) or (3) with a copy of a wealth-restraining order must –\n                (a) make a statutory declaration as to the matters set out in subsection (2) ; and\n                (b) file the declaration in the Supreme Court within 7 days after being served with the copy.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 2 000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or both.\n        (2) A statutory declaration under subsection (1) is to include –\n                (a) the name and, if known, the address of any other person of whom the declarant is aware who has, may have or claims to have an interest in property affected by the wealth-restraining order; or\n                (b) if the declarant is not aware of another such person, a statement to that effect.\n\n124. Effect of wealth-restraining orders\n        (1) While a wealth-restraining order is in effect in relation to property –\n                (a) subject to Subdivision 3 , a person is not entitled to deal with the property; and\n                (b) subject to section 121(a) , the DPP may arrange for a police officer to seize, retain or guard the property, or for the property to be secured by other means, for the duration of the wealth-restraining order; and\n                (c) the DPP may apply under this Part to the Supreme Court for an order that all or some of the property, or a class of property, be forfeited to the State under Subdivision 3 of Division 6 .\n        (2) Income or other property that is derived from restrained property is taken to be part of the restrained property.\n        (3) The owner, or the person with effective control, of restrained property may apply to the Supreme Court for the release of all or some of the restrained property to meet reasonable living and business expenses of the applicant.\n\n125. Co-owned restrained property\n    If property is, or is to be, restrained property and the person named in the wealth-restraining order is one of the co-owners of the property, the Supreme Court is to order that the whole of the property is restrained property unless –\n            (a) the property is divisible; or\n            (b) it is otherwise practicable for only the share of the person named in the wealth-restraining order to be restrained.\n\n126. Duration of wealth-restraining orders\n        (1) Subject to this Part, a wealth-restraining order has effect for the period specified in it.\n        (2) On application, the Supreme Court may extend the duration of the wealth-restraining order on as many occasions as the Supreme Court sees fit.\n        (3) If the period of a wealth-restraining order is extended under this section, the DPP must serve a notice of the extension on each person on whom a copy of the wealth-restraining order was served under section 122 .\n\n127. Wealth-restraining orders cease to have effect\n        (1) If a wealth-restraining order has been made on the ground that an application had been made, or was to be made, for a document production order or an unexplained wealth declaration, the wealth-restraining order ceases to have effect if –\n                (a) within 21 days from the making of the wealth-restraining order, an application has not been made for the document production order or the unexplained wealth declaration; or\n                (b) the application for the document production order or the unexplained wealth declaration is withdrawn for any reason; or\n                (c) the application for the document production order or unexplained wealth declaration is finally determined but a document production order or unexplained wealth declaration is not made as a result of the application; or\n                (d) in the case where an unexplained wealth declaration is made, the respondent has satisfied his or her unexplained wealth liability under the unexplained wealth declaration, whether or not all or any of the restrained property was transferred to, or vested in, the State to satisfy the liability.\n        (2) A wealth-restraining order also ceases to have effect in respect of property –\n                (a) if the wealth-restraining order is set aside under Division 4 ; or\n                (b) if that property is forfeited to the State under Subdivision 3 of Division 6 .\n        (3) If a wealth-restraining order ceases to have effect, the DPP is to ensure that –\n                (a) notice that the wealth-restraining order has ceased to have effect is served personally, as soon as practicable, on each person on whom a copy of the wealth-restraining order was served under section 122 ; and\n                (b) any property that is being retained under section 115 is returned to the person from whom it was taken unless it is to be otherwise dealt with under this Act or another Act; and\n                (c) any property that is being guarded under section 115 is released from guard unless it is guarded for another reason under this Act or another Act; and\n                (d) if the DPP is aware that the person to whom property is to be returned under paragraph (b) is not the owner of the property, the owner is notified, where practicable, of the setting aside of the wealth-restraining order and the return of the property.\n\n128. Land restrained under wealth-restraining order\n        (1) If land is to be restrained property under a wealth-restraining order –\n                (a) the DPP must lodge with the Recorder a sealed copy of the wealth-restraining order; and\n                (b) if the land is not registered under the Land Titles Act 1980 , the Recorder is to –\n                        (i) bring the land under the Land Titles Act 1980 as if an application had been made under section 11 of that Act; and\n                        (ii) register the wealth-restraining order against the relevant folio of the Register; and\n                (c) if the land is registered under the Land Titles Act 1980 , the Recorder is to register the wealth-restraining order against the relevant folio of the Register.\n        (2) Land only becomes restrained property under a wealth-restraining order once the wealth-restraining order is registered under subsection (1)(b)(ii) or (1)(c) .\n        (3) If, in accordance with section 127 , a wealth-restraining order registered under subsection (1) ceases to have effect and restrained property under the wealth-restraining order includes land –\n                (a) the DPP must lodge notification with the Recorder that the wealth-restraining order has ceased to have effect; and\n                (b) the Recorder is to register the notification against the relevant folio of the Register.\n        (4) A wealth-restraining order registered under subsection (1) ceases to have effect in relation to the restrained property that is land when evidence that the wealth-restraining order has ceased to have effect is registered under subsection (3)(b) .\n\n129. Property may be restrained under more than one order\n        (1) A restraining order, and a specified restraining order, may both apply to restrained property at the same time on the same, or different, grounds.\n        (2) If a restraining order and a specified restraining order both apply to property, the fact that one of the orders ceases to have effect in respect of the property does not affect any other order still in effect in respect of the property.\n\nSubdivision 3 - Dealing with restrained property\n\n130. Dealing with property\n        (1) In addition to section 7 , a reference in this Part to dealing with property includes a reference to doing or attempting to do any of the following:\n                (a) sell the property or give it away;\n                (b) dispose of the property in any other way;\n                (c) move or exhaust the property;\n                (d) accept the property as a gift;\n                (e) take any profit, benefit or proceeds from the property;\n                (f) create, increase or alter any legal or equitable right or obligation in relation to the property;\n                (g) effect a change in the effective control of the property.\n        (2) In subsection (1) , a reference to dealing with property does not include reasonable and necessary use for the ordinary daily requirements of living.\n\n131. Permitted dealings in respect of mortgaged or leased property\n        (1) If property that is mortgaged is subject to a specified restraining order, this Part does not prevent –\n                (a) the mortgagor from making payments to the mortgagee in accordance with the mortgage if the payments are made with money that is not subject to a specified restraining order; or\n                (b) the mortgagee from accepting payments from the mortgagor in accordance with the mortgage; or\n                (c) the issue of a notice of default by a mortgagee, and the exercise of the mortgagee's rights, under the terms of the mortgage or as specified in legislation.\n        (2) If property that is leased is subject to a specified restraining order, this Part does not prevent –\n                (a) the tenant from making payments to the landlord in accordance with the lease if the payments are made with money that is not subject to a specified restraining order; or\n                (b) the landlord from accepting payments from the tenant in accordance with the lease; or\n                (c) the renewal of a pre-existing lease agreement over land; or\n                (d) the issue of a notice of default by a landlord, and the exercise of the landlord's rights, under the terms of the lease or as specified in legislation.\n\n132. Persons must not deal with restrained property\n        (1) A person must not, in any way, deal with –\n                (a) restrained property; or\n                (b) property that is subject to an interim wealth-restraining order.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 1 000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both.\n        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to –\n                (a) the forfeiture of the property under this Part; or\n                (b) a person acting in accordance with the specified restraining order under which the property is restrained; or\n                (c) a person acting in accordance with an order under section 121(b) , 162(2) or 164(2) ; or\n                (d) a person acting in accordance with a demand of the Public Trustee under section 161 .\n        (3) It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence under subsection (1) if the person establishes that he or she did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, that a specified restraining order was in force when dealing with the property.\n        (4) Subsection (1) does not prevent a person from being found guilty of contempt of court for a contravention of the specified restraining order under which the property is restrained, but the person is not punishable for both contempt and an offence under subsection (1) arising from the same contravention of the specified restraining order.\n\n133. Effect of dealing with properties subject to wealth-restraining orders\n    Despite any other Act, any dealing with property that contravenes section 132 has no effect, whether at law, in equity or otherwise, on the rights of the State under this Part.\n\nDivision 4 - Objections to restraint of property\n\n134. Objections to restraining of property\n        (1) A person may file an objection in the Supreme Court to property, owned or effectively controlled by the person, being restrained property.\n        (2) An objection is to identify –\n                (a) the property to which the objection relates; and\n                (b) the grounds for objection against the property being restrained property.\n\n135. Time for filing objections\n        (1) If the person who intends to file an objection under section 134(1) was served with a copy of the order under section 122 , the objection is to be filed within 28 days from the day on which the copy was served on the person.\n        (2) If the person who intends to file an objection under section 134(1) was not served with a copy of the order under section 122 , the objection is to be filed within 28 days from the day on which the person becomes aware, or could reasonably be expected to have become aware, that the property has been restrained.\n        (3) The Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, hear an objection under subsection (1) or (2) that is filed outside of the time frame specified in the relevant subsection.\n\n136. Parties to objection proceedings\n    The State is a party to proceedings on the filing of an objection under section 134 .\n\n137. Setting aside or varying restraining orders\n        (1) On hearing an objection under this Division to property being restrained property under a wealth-restraining order, the Supreme Court may set aside or vary all, or any part, of the wealth-restraining order as it applies to the restrained property, or class of restrained property, specified in the application.\n        (2) The Supreme Court may only set aside or vary the wealth-restraining order as it applies to the restrained property if satisfied that it is more likely than not that the person who is, or will be, the subject of an unexplained wealth declaration does not own or effectively control the property.\n        (3) If the Supreme Court sets aside or varies a specified restraining order under this Division, the Supreme Court may make any necessary or convenient ancillary orders.\n\nDivision 5 - Unexplained wealth declaration\n\n138. What constitutes a person's wealth\n    For the purposes of this Act, the following property and benefits constitute a person's wealth:\n            (a) all property that the person owns, whether the property was acquired before or after the commencement of this Part;\n            (b) all property that the person effectively controls, whether the person acquired effective control of the property before or after the commencement of this Part;\n            (c) all property that the person has given away at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part;\n            (d) all other property acquired by the person at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, including consumer goods and consumer durables that have been consumed or discarded (but not including necessary food, clothing and other items reasonably necessary for the ordinary daily requirements of living);\n            (e) all benefits, including commercial benefits, that the person has acquired at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part;\n            (f) all property and benefits acquired, at the request or direction of the person, by another person at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, including consumer goods and consumer durables that have been consumed or discarded (but not including necessary food, clothing and other items reasonably necessary for the ordinary daily requirements of living).\n\n139. Unexplained wealth\n        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person may have unexplained wealth if the value of the person's total wealth as described in subsection (2) is greater than the value of the person's lawfully acquired wealth as described in subsection (3) .\n        (2) The value of the person's total wealth is the total value of all the items of property and benefits that together constitute the person's wealth.\n        (3) The value of the person's lawfully acquired wealth is the total value of all the items of property and benefits that –\n                (a) constitute the person's wealth; and\n                (b) were lawfully acquired.\n\n140. Assessing the value of unexplained wealth\n        (1) A person's unexplained wealth is the difference in value between –\n                (a) the value of a person's total wealth; and\n                (b) the value of a person's lawfully acquired wealth.\n        (2) When assessing the value of a person's wealth –\n                (a) the value of any property or benefit that is a constituent of the person's wealth is taken to be the greater of –\n                        (i) its value at the time that it was acquired; or\n                        (ii) its value on the day that the application for the unexplained wealth declaration was made; and\n                (b) the value of any property or benefit that was a constituent of the person's wealth but has been given away, used, consumed or discarded, or that is for any other reason no longer available, is taken to be an outgoing at the greater of –\n                        (i) its value at the time that it was acquired; or\n                        (ii) its value immediately before it was given away, or was used, consumed or discarded, or ceased being available; and\n                (c) the Supreme Court is not to take account of –\n                        (i) any property that has been forfeited under this Act or any other Act; or\n                        (ii) any property or benefit that was taken into account in making an earlier unexplained wealth declaration against the person; or\n                        (iii) any property or benefit in relation to which a pecuniary penalty order has been made.\n\n141. Application for unexplained wealth declaration\n        (1) The DPP may apply to the Supreme Court for an unexplained wealth declaration to be made against a person.\n        (2) An application under subsection (1) may be made –\n                (a) in conjunction with an application under Part 2 of this Act; or\n                (b) in proceedings, under Division 4 , for the hearing of an objection to the application of a specified restraining order in respect of property; or\n                (c) at any other time.\n\n142. Unexplained wealth declaration\n        (1) On hearing an application under section 141 , the Supreme Court may make an unexplained wealth declaration against a person named in the application.\n        (2) The Supreme Court must make an unexplained wealth declaration if satisfied that it is more likely than not that the value of the person's total wealth is greater than the value of his or her lawfully acquired wealth.\n        (3) Without limiting the matters to which the Supreme Court may have regard in determining the value of a respondent's total wealth, the Supreme Court may have regard to the amount of the respondent's income and outgoings at any time or at all times.\n        (4) On making an unexplained wealth declaration against a respondent, the Supreme Court –\n                (a) is to specify in the declaration the assessed value of the respondent's unexplained wealth as determined by the Court; and\n                (b) is to order, in the declaration, that the respondent pay to the State the amount specified in the declaration as the value of his or her unexplained wealth; and\n                (c) may make any necessary or convenient ancillary orders, including awarding costs as it sees fit.\n\n143. Unexplained wealth liability\n    The unexplained wealth liability of a respondent is the total of –\n            (a) the amount the respondent is ordered to pay under section 142(4)(b) in respect of an unexplained wealth declaration; and\n            (b) any costs awarded under section 142(4)(c) in respect of the unexplained wealth declaration or the respondent.\n\n144.

Recovery of amount payable to State\n        (1) A respondent must pay his or her unexplained wealth liability –\n                (a) before the date specified in the unexplained wealth declaration, being a date that is at least 31 days after the day on which that declaration was made; or\n                (b) if no such date is specified, within 31 days after the day on which that declaration was made.\n        (2) If all, or part, of an unexplained wealth liability is not paid within the relevant time specified in subsection (1) , the DPP may refer the unpaid amount for collection under section 41 of the Monetary Penalties Enforcement Act 2005 as if –\n                (a) the DPP were a court; and\n                (b) the unexplained wealth declaration, that resulted in the unexplained wealth liability, were an order imposing a fine.\n        (3) This section does not affect any other means, under this Part, by which the State may recover any unpaid amount of an unexplained wealth liability.\n\n146. Use of restrained property to meet unexplained wealth liability\n        (1) To satisfy an unexplained wealth liability wholly or in part, the person who has the liability may transfer to the State any property wholly owned, or effectively controlled solely, by the person, whether or not the property is restrained property.\n        (2) Nothing in subsection (1) authorises a person to transfer property other than in accordance with this Act or any other Act.\n        (3) If a person who has an unexplained wealth liability has not satisfied the liability under subsection (1) within the relevant time specified in section 145(1) , any property of the person that is subject to a specified restraining order and is wholly owned, or effectively controlled solely, by the person may –\n                (a) be used by the respondent to satisfy his or her liability under section 144 ; or\n                (b) be forfeited to the State under this Part to satisfy his or her liability under section 144 .\n\n147.

Nexus between restraint and forfeiture not necessary\n    Restrained property, that is owned or effectively controlled by a respondent, is at risk of forfeiture under a wealth forfeiture order to satisfy an unexplained wealth declaration against the respondent despite the grounds for the wealth forfeiture order being different from the grounds for the wealth-restraining order that affects the property.\n\nSubdivision 2 - Use of effectively controlled property or gift to meet unexplained wealth liability\n\n149. Limitation on use of effectively controlled property\n    Property that is the subject of –\n            (a) a forfeitable property declaration made on the basis of the property being effectively controlled, or given away, by a respondent; or\n            (b) a wealth-restraining order made on the basis of the property being effectively controlled by a respondent –\n    is only to be called upon to satisfy the respondent's unexplained wealth liability if property owned by the respondent is not available or is insufficient to satisfy the liability.\n\n150.

Forfeitable property declarations\n        (1) On hearing an application under section 150 or 157(1)(a) , the Supreme Court may make a forfeitable property declaration in respect of property specified in the application.\n        (2) The Supreme Court may only make a forfeitable property declaration in relation to property if satisfied that it is more likely than not that –\n                (a) the respondent to an unexplained wealth declaration effectively controlled all or part of the property at the time that the application was made under Division 5 for the unexplained wealth declaration made against the respondent; or\n                (b) before an application was made under Division 5 for an unexplained wealth declaration against the respondent, the respondent to the unexplained wealth declaration –\n                        (i) owned or effectively controlled the property; and\n                        (ii) gave the property away.\n        (3) For the purposes of making a forfeitable property declaration under subsection (2) , the Supreme Court may presume the property specified in the application for the declaration was –\n                (a) at the relevant time, effectively controlled by the respondent to the relevant unexplained wealth declaration; or\n                (b) before the relevant time, given away by the respondent to the relevant unexplained wealth declaration –\n        unless the respondent, or another person, proves otherwise.\n        (4) A forfeitable property declaration enables the Supreme Court to make a wealth forfeiture order in respect of the property specified in the forfeitable property declaration.\n        (5) If the Supreme Court makes a forfeitable property declaration under this section, it may make any necessary or convenient ancillary orders.\n\nSubdivision 3 - Forfeiture of property\n\n152. Wealth forfeiture orders\n        (1) The DPP may apply to the Supreme Court for a wealth forfeiture order to be made in respect of property that –\n                (a) is restrained property; or\n                (b) subject to section 149 , is specified in a forfeitable property declaration.\n        (2) On hearing an application under subsection (1) or section 157(1)(b) , the Supreme Court may make an order declaring that property specified in the order is forfeit to the State.\n        (3) The Supreme Court may only make an order under subsection (2) in relation to property if satisfied that the forfeiture of the property to the State is necessary to satisfy an unexplained wealth declaration.\n\n153.
