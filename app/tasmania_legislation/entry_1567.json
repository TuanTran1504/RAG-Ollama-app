Defence in respect of sale of unfit equipment or packaging or labelling material\n    In any proceedings for an offence under section 20(1) or (2) , it is a defence if the person proves that the person reasonably believed that the equipment or material concerned was not intended for use in connection with the handling of food.\n\n29. Defence of mistaken but reasonable belief not available\n    In any proceedings for an offence under Division 2 , it is no defence that the person had a mistaken but reasonable belief as to the facts that constituted the offence.\n\n30. Onus on person to prove certain statements about food\n        (1) This section applies to a proceeding for an offence under this Part in which it is alleged that a statement on a package of food, or in an advertisement about food, that relates to the origin or composition of the food, or its therapeutic or nutritive properties, caused the food to be falsely described.\n        (2) If a person charged with an offence under this Part was responsible for making the statement, the onus of proving the correctness of the statement is on the person.\n\n31. Alternative verdicts for serious food offences\n        (1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence against section 13 , the trier of fact is not satisfied that the person committed the offence but is satisfied that the person committed an offence against section 16(1) , the trier of fact may find the person not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of an offence against section 16(1) , and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.\n        (2) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence against section 14 , the trier of fact is not satisfied that the person committed the offence but is satisfied that the person committed an offence against section 16(2) , the trier of fact may find the person not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of an offence against section 16(2) , and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.\n\nPART 3 - Emergency powers\n\n32.
