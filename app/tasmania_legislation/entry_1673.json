Purpose and effect of rules (ASCR 2)\n        (1) The purpose of these rules is to assist solicitors to act ethically and in accordance with the principles of professional conduct established by the common law and these rules.\n        (2) In considering whether a solicitor has engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct, the rules apply in addition to the common law.\n        (3) A breach of these rules is capable of constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct, and may give rise to disciplinary action by the relevant regulatory authority, but cannot be enforced by a third party.\n\nDivision 2 - Fundamental duties of solicitors\n\n7. Paramount duty to court and administration of justice (ASCR 3)\n    A solicitors duty to the court and the administration of justice is paramount and prevails to the extent of inconsistency with any other duty.\n\n8.

Dishonest and disreputable conduct (ASCR 5)\n    A solicitor must not engage in conduct, in the course of practice or otherwise, which demonstrates that the solicitor is not a fit and proper person to practise law, or which is likely to a material degree to –\n            (a) be prejudicial to, or diminish the public confidence in, the administration of justice; or\n            (b) bring the profession into disrepute.\n\n10. Undertakings (ASCR 6)\n        (1) A solicitor who has given an undertaking in the course of legal practice must honour that undertaking and ensure the timely and effective performance of the undertaking, unless released by the recipient or by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n        (2) A solicitor must not seek from another solicitor, or that solicitors employee, associate or agent, undertakings in respect of a matter that would require the co-operation of a third party who is not party to the undertaking.\n\nDivision 3 - Relations with clients\n\n11. Communication of advice (ASCR 7)\n        (1) A solicitor must provide clear and timely advice to assist a client to understand relevant legal issues and to make informed choices about action to be taken during the course of a matter, consistent with the terms of the engagement.\n        (2) A solicitor must inform the client or the instructing solicitor about the alternatives to fully contested adjudication of the case which are reasonably available to the client, unless the solicitor believes on reasonable grounds that the client already has such an understanding of those alternatives as to permit the client to make decisions about the clients best interests in relation to the matter.\n\n12. Client instructions (ASCR 8)\n    A solicitor must follow a clients lawful, proper and competent instructions.\n\n13. Confidentiality (ASCR 9)\n        (1) Except as permitted in subrule (2) , a solicitor must not disclose any information which is confidential to a client and acquired by the solicitor during the clients engagement to any person who is not –\n                (a) a solicitor who is a partner, principal, director or employee of the solicitors law practice; or\n                (b) a barrister or an employee of, or person otherwise engaged by, the solicitors law practice or by an associated entity for the purposes of delivering or administering legal services in relation to the client.\n        (2) A solicitor may disclose information which is confidential to a client if –\n                (a) the client expressly or impliedly authorises disclosure; or\n                (b) the solicitor is permitted or is compelled by law to disclose; or\n                (c) the solicitor discloses the information in a confidential setting, for the sole purpose of obtaining advice in connection with the solicitors legal or ethical obligations; or\n                (d) the solicitor discloses the information for the sole purpose of avoiding the probable commission of a serious criminal offence; or\n                (e) the solicitor discloses the information for the purpose of preventing imminent serious physical harm to the client or to another person; or\n                (f) the information is disclosed to the insurer of the solicitor, law practice or associated entity.\n\n14.

and\n                (b) whose testimony provides reasonable grounds for the prosecutor to believe that it could provide admissible evidence relevant to any matter in issue –\n            unless –\n                (c) the opponent consents to the prosecutor not calling a particular witness; or\n                (d) the only matter with respect to which the particular witness can give admissible evidence has been dealt with by an admission on behalf of the accused; or\n                (e) the only matter with respect to which the particular witness can give admissible evidence goes to establishing a particular point already adequately established by another witness or other witnesses; or\n                (f) the prosecutor believes on reasonable grounds that the testimony of a particular witness is plainly untruthful or is plainly unreliable, provided that the prosecutor must inform the opponent as soon as practicable of the identity of any witness whom the prosecutor intends not to call on any grounds within paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) together with the grounds on which the prosecutor has reached that decision.\n        (8) A prosecutor who has reasonable grounds to believe that certain material available to the prosecution may have been unlawfully or improperly obtained must promptly –\n                (a) inform the opponent if the prosecutor intends to use the material;
