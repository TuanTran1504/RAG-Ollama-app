Choices of services  Principle 1:  Eligible persons must be given the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge as public patients    Explanatory Note 1:  Hospital services include in-patient, out-patient, emergency services (including primary care where appropriate) and day patient services consistent with currently acceptable medical and health service standards.    Explanatory Note 2:  At the time of admission to a hospital, or as soon as practicable after that, an eligible person will be required to elect or confirm whether he or she wishes to be treated as a public or private patient.  Universality of services  Principle 2:  Access to public hospital services is to be on the basis of clinical need    Explanatory Note 1:  None of the following factors are to be a determinant of an eligible person's priority for receiving hospital services:     - whether or not an eligible person has health insurance;     - an eligible person's financial status or place of residence;     - whether or not an eligible person intends to elect, or elects, to be treated as a public or private patient.    Explanatory Note 2:  This principle applies equally to waiting times for elective surgery.  Equity in service provision  Principle 3:  To the maximum practicable extent, a State will ensure the provision of public hospital services equitably to all eligible persons, regardless of their geographical location    Explanatory Note 1:  This principle does not require a local hospital to be equipped to provide eligible persons with every hospital service they may need.    Explanatory Note 2:  In rural and remote areas, a State should ensure provision of reasonable public access to a basic range of hospital services which are in accord with clinical practices.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n\nPART 2 - Commitments\n\nIn order to achieve principles 1 to 3, the Commonwealth and States make the following commitments regarding public hospital services for eligible persons:  Information about service provision  Commitment 1:  The Commonwealth and a State must make available information on the public hospital services eligible persons can expect to receive as public patients    Explanatory Note 1:  The joint Commonwealth/State development of a Public Patients' Hospital Charter for each State will be a vehicle for the public dissemination of this information.
