Form of permits\n        (1) An SSDS permit is to be in an approved form but it must at least specify –\n                (a) whether it is a long-term or short-term SSDS permit; and\n                (b) the name and business address of the person it is issued to; and\n                (c) the authorised SSDS and authorised restricted activity; and\n                (d) the place where the authorised restricted activity is to be carried out (if that place is different from the permit holder's business address); and\n                (e) its date of issue; and\n                (f) when it expires (either by reference to a period or date or, if section 19(3)(b) applies, to the expected duration of the authorised restricted activity).\n        (2) The responsible workers for an SSDS permit may, in the regulator's discretion –\n                (a) be named in the permit itself; or\n                (b) be named in a supplementary document, in an approved form, issued with the permit.\n\n21. Permit conditions\n        (1) An SSDS permit may be issued unconditionally or on such conditions as the regulator determines having regard to the authorised SSDS and authorised restricted activity.\n        (2) The conditions of an SSDS permit may, in the regulator's discretion, be set out –\n                (a) in the permit itself; or\n                (b) in a supplementary document, in an approved form, issued with the permit.\n        (3) The conditions are to be entered in the register.\n        (4) The holder of an SSDS permit must not –\n                (a) contravene a condition of the SSDS permit; or\n                (b) direct, cause or allow a responsible worker or any other person to contravene a condition of the SSDS permit.\n        Penalty: In the case of –\n                (a) a body corporate, a fine not exceeding 500 penalty units and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding 5 penalty units for each day during which the offence continues; and\n                (b) an individual, a fine not exceeding 250 penalty units and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding 2.5 penalty units for each day during which the offence continues.\n        (5) A responsible worker for an SSDS permit must not –\n                (a) contravene a condition of the SSDS permit; or\n                (b) direct, cause or allow another person to contravene a condition of the SSDS permit.\n        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 100 penalty units and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding 1 penalty unit for each day during which the offence continues.\n\n22. What do permits authorise?\n        (1) An SSDS permit authorises the holder of the permit and each responsible worker to carry out the restricted activity specified in the permit, in relation to the SSDS specified in the permit, in accordance with –\n                (a) the conditions of the permit; and\n                (b) any prescribed conditions.\n        (2) An SSDS permit also authorises other persons to carry out the restricted activity specified in the permit, in relation to the SSDS specified in the permit, if they are –\n                (a) employees or agents of the holder of the permit; and\n                (b) working under the direct and constant supervision of the holder of the permit or a responsible worker.\n\n23. Mutual recognition\n        (1) The regulator, by notice in the Gazette, may certify that a class of permit capable of being issued under a corresponding Australian law is recognised in this State if the regulator is satisfied that the permits of that class correspond, or substantially correspond, to SSDS permits.\n        (2) A permit that is of a class recognised in this State by virtue of a regulator's certification under subsection (1) has force and effect in this State, according to its terms, as an SSDS permit to the same extent to which it is in force and effect in the jurisdiction in which it was issued.\n        (3) Also, a person whose status or authority in respect of a recognised permit corresponds to the status or authority of a responsible worker under an SSDS permit is taken to be a responsible worker for that recognised permit if and when the person is required to work in this State under that recognised permit.\n        (4) Subsection (3) has effect whether the corresponding status and authority referred to in that subsection is derived from the recognised permit itself or from a separate permit issued to the person under a corresponding Australian law.\n        (5) The regulations may provide for the recognition of other matters under corresponding Australian laws for the purpose of enabling persons who are authorised to carry out a restricted activity in relation to an SSDS in another jurisdiction (with or without supervision) to carry out the same restricted activity in this State.\n        (6) A notice under subsection (1) is not a statutory rule within the meaning of the Rules Publication Act 1953 .\n        (7) In this section –\n            issued includes granted, conferred and awarded;\n            permit includes any form of regulatory authority besides a permit;\n            recognised permit means a permit, issued under a corresponding Australian law, that has force and effect in this State as an SSDS permit by virtue of a certification under subsection (1) .\n\n24. Permits are not transferable\n    An SSDS permit is not transferable.\n\n25. Renewal of permits\n        (1) A short-term SSDS permit is not renewable.\n        (2) A long-term SSDS permit is from time to time renewable.\n        (3) An application to renew a long-term SSDS permit is to be in an approved form and –\n                (a) is to be made to the regulator at least one month (but not more than 3 months) before the permit is due to expire; and\n                (b) may be made even if the permit is suspended.\n        (4) However, the regulator, in his or her absolute discretion, may accept a late application to renew a long-term SSDS permit if –\n                (a) the permit has not expired; and\n                (b) the applicant pays a prescribed penalty, if any.\n        (5) If an application to renew a long-term SSDS permit is not determined before the day on which it is due to expire, it is, despite section 27 , taken to continue in force on and after that day until whichever of the following first occurs:\n                (a) the 3-month period immediately following that day expires;\n                (b) the permit is renewed or its renewal is refused.\n        (6) However, subsection (5) does not apply to a suspended long-term SSDS permit if it is still suspended immediately before the day on which it is due to expire.\n        (7) Section 10(1) and section 18 have the same application to an application for the renewal of a long-term SSDS permit as they have to an application for the issue of an SSDS permit.\n        (8) Despite subsection (5) , the renewal of a long-term SSDS permit takes effect on the day on which, but for the renewal, it would have expired.\n        (9) A refusal to renew a long-term SSDS permit takes effect on the day on which the holder of the permit is notified of the refusal.\n        (10) The regulator is to issue the holder of a long-term SSDS permit with a fresh permit on its renewal.\n\n26. Surrender of permits\n        (1) The holder of an SSDS permit may surrender it at any time.\n        (2) The surrender takes effect when the regulator is notified of it.\n        (3) However, the surrender is not effective unless the notification to the regulator is accompanied by –\n                (a) the SSDS permit; or\n                (b) a statutory declaration as to its loss, theft or destruction.\n\n27. Expiry of permits\n        (1) Unless it is renewed, a long-term SSDS permit expires 3 years after the day on which it is issued.\n        (2) A short-term SSDS permit expires –\n                (a) if section 19(3)(a) applies, on the expiration of the period for which it is issued; or\n                (b) if section 19(3)(b) applies, on the completion of the authorised restricted activity or after 12 months, whichever occurs first.\n\nDivision 4 - Regulation of SSDS permits\n\n28. Register of permits\n        (1) The regulator is to keep a register of SSDS permits.\n        (2) The register is to be kept in such manner as the regulator determines and, without limiting that discretion, may be kept wholly or partly by use of a computer.\n        (3) The regulator is to ensure that the entries made in the register for each SSDS permit are sufficient to identify –\n                (a) the holder of the permit; and\n                (b) the authorised SSDS; and\n                (c) the authorised restricted activity; and\n                (d) the conditions of the permit; and\n                (e) the responsible workers, if any; and\n                (f) when the permit was issued; and\n                (g) when (by reference to a date or event) the permit expires; and\n                (h) any prescribed matters.\n        (4) The regulator is to make such other entries in the register about SSDS permits as the regulator determines or this Act or the regulations require.\n        (5) The register is not a public register but the regulator may make the register available, or provide information from the register, to –\n                (a) a government department or other agency of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, having SSDS responsibilities; or\n                (b) any other person who the regulator reasonably considers has a legitimate reason to access the register.\n        (6) Without limiting subsection (5)(b) , the regulator may allow the holder of an SSDS permit to verify, without fee, a register entry relating to that permit.\n        (7) In providing any person with access to the register, or information from the register, the regulator is to have regard to considerations of commercial confidentiality, State security and public safety.\n        (8) However, the Commissioner of Police is entitled to have unrestricted free access to the register and to be provided with any information from the register.\n\n29. Variation of permit conditions\n        (1) The regulator may vary the conditions of an SSDS permit at any time by doing one or more of the following:\n                (a) omitting a condition;\n                (b) amending or substituting a condition;\n                (c) imposing an extra condition.\n        (2) The variation is to be entered in the register.\n        (3) The variation may be done –\n                (a) on the application of the holder of the permit; or\n                (b) on the regulator's own initiative.\n        (4) If the regulator reasonably considers that an application under subsection (3)(a) has any security implications, he or she is to –\n                (a) refer a copy of the application to the Commissioner of Police; and\n                (b) allow the Commissioner of Police a reasonable period (of at least 10 clear days) to consider it; and\n                (c) take any advice or recommendations of the Commissioner of Police into account in determining the application.\n        (5) If subsection (3)(a) applies and the application is approved, the regulator is to notify the applicant of the approval, the variation and when the variation is to take effect.\n        (6) If subsection (3)(a) applies and the application is refused, the regulator is to notify the applicant of –\n                (a) the refusal; and\n                (b) subject to section 73 , the reasons for the refusal; and\n                (c) the applicant's right of review.\n        (7) If subsection (3)(b) applies, the regulator is to notify the holder of the permit of –\n                (a) the variation; and\n                (b) subject to section 73 , the reasons for the variation; and\n                (c) when the variation is to take effect; and\n                (d) if the variation has the effect of making the permit conditions more restrictive, the applicant's right of review.\n        (8) The regulator may consult the permit holder before varying the conditions of an SSDS permit on the regulator's own initiative, but there is no obligation to consider exercising that discretion if the regulator considers that the variation should be effected urgently in the public interest.\n        (9) The regulator, if he or she thinks it is warranted, may issue the holder of an SSDS permit with an updated permit and updated supplementary documents when its conditions are varied.\n\n30. Amendment of permit particulars\n        (1) The holder of an SSDS permit is to notify the regulator of any change in the permit particulars.\n        (2) On receiving the notification, the regulator –\n                (a) is to amend the register as necessary; and\n                (b) may, if the regulator thinks it is warranted, issue the applicant with an updated permit containing the amended particulars.\n        (3) In this section –\n            permit particulars includes such things as business and email addresses, telephone numbers and other contact information but does not include –\n                    (a) the permit conditions; or\n                    (b) the names of responsible workers.\n\n31. Cancellation and suspension of permits by regulator\n        (1) The regulator must –\n                (a) suspend an SSDS permit immediately if the holder of the permit is charged with a terrorism offence; and\n                (b) cancel an SSDS permit immediately if the holder of the permit is convicted of a terrorism offence.\n        (2) The regulator may cancel or suspend an SSDS permit at any time if the regulator believes on reasonable grounds that –\n                (a) the holder of the permit no longer requires it or can no longer demonstrate a legitimate need for it; or\n                (b) the conditions of the permit have been or are being contravened; or\n                (c) persons other than the holder of the permit or responsible workers have been carrying out the authorised restricted activity without supervision or adequate supervision; or\n                (d) the holder of the permit has given the regulator false or misleading information in or in connection with an application or nomination or about another matter under this Act; or\n                (e) the holder of the permit has contravened this Act, a related State law or a corresponding Australian law; or\n                (f) the holder of the permit has contravened a direction under Division 6 ; or\n                (g) the holder of the permit has, either in this State or elsewhere, committed an offence involving –\n                        (i) violence or weapons; or\n                        (ii) dishonesty; or\n                        (iii) the obstruction or intimidation of persons exercising statutory powers or functions; or\n                (h) the holder of the permit has, either in this State or elsewhere, committed an offence of another kind that calls into question his or her fitness or competence to continue holding the SSDS permit; or\n                (i) the holder of the permit is subject to a restrictive personal order; or\n                (j) the suspension is prudent or necessary having regard to a security threat.\n        (3) In deciding under subsection (2) whether cancellation or suspension is the more appropriate course of action in the circumstances, the regulator is to regard State security and public safety, rather than the rights and convenience of the holder of the SSDS permit, as being the paramount consideration.\n        (4) The cancellation or suspension takes effect when the holder of the SSDS permit is notified of it.\n        (5) Subject to section 73 , the notification of cancellation or suspension is to –\n                (a) specify the reasons for the cancellation or suspension; and\n                (b) indicate, in general terms, any information that the regulator took into account in making the decision to cancel or suspend; and\n                (c) advise that there is a right of review against the decision; and\n                (d) specify, in the case of a suspension, the period of suspension and any conditions that must be met before the regulator will consider revoking the suspension; and\n                (e) if necessary, contain instructions for securing or disposing of any SSDS affected by the cancellation or suspension.\n        (6) The regulator may, by notifying the holder of the permit, revoke the suspension of an SSDS permit at any time.\n        (7) The regulator may consult the permit holder before cancelling or suspending an SSDS permit, but there is no obligation to consider exercising that discretion if the regulator considers that the cancellation or suspension should be effected urgently in the public interest.\n        (8) A suspended SSDS permit is of no effect during the period of suspension.\n        (9) However, a person who is acting strictly in accordance with instructions issued to the person pursuant to subsection (5)(e) is not guilty of any offence under this Act.\n        (10) The cancellation or suspension of an SSDS permit is to be entered in the register.\n\n32. Cancellation of permits by courts\n        (1) A court that convicts a person of an offence against this Act or a related State law may, in addition to imposing any other penalty, cancel an SSDS permit held by the person if the court, having regard to the nature of the offence and the objects of this Act, is satisfied that –\n                (a) it is not in the public interest for the person to continue to hold the permit; or\n                (b) the cancellation of the permit is merited in order to add to the punitive effect of the sentence or to deter others from committing the same offence.\n        (2) The cancellation is to be entered in the register.\n\n33.
