Subordinate legislation must be expressed plainly and unambiguously, and consistently with the language of the enabling Act.\n\n    SCHEDULE 2 - Provisions Applying to Regulatory Impact Statements\n\n    Section 5\n\n        1.

If this is not possible, the anticipated impacts of the proposed action and of each alternative must be stated and presented in a way that permits a comparison of the costs and benefits.\n\n    SCHEDULE 3 - Exempt Matters and Categories\n\n    Section 6\n\n    PART 1\n\n        1.
