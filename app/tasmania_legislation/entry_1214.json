Use of documents and information\n        (1) For the purpose of making a determination or exercising a discretion under this Act, or for the purpose of complying with any obligations imposed by the relevant Ministerial arrangements under Part 3 , the Minister –\n                (a) may inform himself or herself as the Minister thinks fit including, in particular, by reference to relevant documents and information –\n                        (i) forwarded to the Minister by the designated authority of another State or a Territory; or\n                        (ii) obtained in the course of investigations carried out in this State in connection with the making of the determination or the exercise of the discretion; and\n                (b) may provide any of those documents or that information (including any personal information about the person to whom a parole order relates) to any government agencies or other persons that may be directly affected by that person's presence in the State or Territory in which the parole order is, or is proposed to be, registered.\n        (2) This section does not authorise the disclosure of information about a person to whom a parole order relates unless the person –\n                (a) has given consent to, or has requested, the registration of the parole order under this Act or under the relevant corresponding law (as the case requires), and has not withdrawn that consent or request; or\n                (b) is present in the State or Territory in which the parole order is, or is proposed to be, registered; or\n                (c) has applied for permission to travel to that State or Territory.\n        (3) A person who has given consent to, or has requested, the registration of a parole order, as referred to in subsection (2)(a) , may withdraw the consent or request at any time before (but not after) the parole order is registered.\n\n12. Delegation\n        (1) The Minister may, either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation, by writing signed by him, delegate to a State Service officer or State Service employee such of his powers under this Act (other than this power of delegation) as are specified in the instrument, and may, by a similar instrument, revoke wholly or in part any such delegation.\n        (2) A power so delegated, when exercised by the delegate, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have been exercised by the Minister.\n        (3) A delegation under this section does not prevent the exercise of a power by the Minister.\n\n13. Regulations\n    The Governor may make regulations for the purposes of this Act."
