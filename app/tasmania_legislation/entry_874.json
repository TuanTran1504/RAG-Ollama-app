Intestate\n    An intestate is a person who dies and either does not leave a will or leaves a will but does not dispose effectively by will of all or part of his or her property.\n\n6. Spouse\n    A spouse of an intestate is a person –\n            (a) who was married to the intestate immediately before the intestate's death; or\n            (b) who was a party to a registered personal relationship, within the meaning of the Relationships Act 2003 , with the intestate; or\n            (c) who, immediately before the intestate's death, was a party to a significant relationship, within the meaning of the Relationships Act 2003 , with the intestate that –\n                    (i) had been in existence for a continuous period of at least 2 years; or\n                    (ii) had resulted in the birth of a child.\n\n7. Spouse's statutory legacy\n        (1) The statutory legacy for a spouse consists of –\n                (a) the CPI adjusted legacy; and\n                (b) if the statutory legacy is not paid, or not paid in full, within one year after the intestate's death, interest at the relevant rate on the amount outstanding from time to time (excluding interest) from the first anniversary of the intestate's death to the date of payment of the legacy in full.\n        (2) The \"CPI adjusted legacy\" is to be determined in accordance with the following formula:\n        where –\n            R represents the CPI adjusted legacy;\n            A is to equal $350 000;\n            C represents the Consumer Price Index number for the last quarter for which such a number was published before the date on which the intestate died;\n            D represents the Consumer Price Index number for the December 2009 quarter.\n        (3) If, however, a spouse is entitled to a statutory legacy under this Act and under the law of another Australian jurisdiction or jurisdictions –\n                (a) the spouse's statutory legacy is an amount equivalent to the highest amount fixed by way of statutory legacy under any of the relevant laws (including this Act); but\n                (b) the following qualifications apply:\n                        (i) amounts received by the spouse, by way of statutory legacy, under any of the other relevant laws are taken to have been paid towards satisfaction of the spouse's statutory legacy under this Act;\n                        (ii) if any of the relevant laws contain no provision corresponding to subparagraph (i) , no amount is payable by way of statutory legacy under this Act until the spouse's entitlement under that law is satisfied, or the spouse renounces the spouse's entitlement to payment, or further payment, by way of statutory legacy, under that law.\n        (4) If the value of an intestate estate is insufficient to allow for the payment of a statutory legacy (or statutory legacies) in full, the statutory legacy abates to the necessary extent and, if 2 or more statutory legacies are payable, they abate rateably.\n        (5) The \"relevant rate\" of interest is the rate that lies 2% above the cash rate last published by the Reserve Bank of Australia before 1 January in the calendar year in which interest begins to accrue.\n        (6) If the Australian Statistician publishes a Consumer Price Index number in respect of a particular quarter in substitution for a Consumer Price Index number previously published in respect of that quarter –\n                (a) except as provided by paragraph (b) , the publication of the later Index number is to be disregarded; or\n                (b) if the Minister so directs, regard is to be had to the later and not to the earlier Index number.\n        (7) If the reference base for the Consumer Price Index is changed, regard is to be had only to Index numbers published in terms of the new reference base or to Index numbers converted to the new reference base in accordance with an arithmetical conversion factor specified by the Australian Statistician.\n        (8) An adjustment under subsection (3) is to be made to the nearest whole dollar.\n        (9) In this section –\n            Consumer Price Index number, for a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.\n\n8. Survivorship\n        (1) A person will not be regarded as having survived an intestate unless –\n                (a) the person is born before the intestate's death and survives the intestate by at least 30 days; or\n                (b) the person is born after the intestate's death after a period of gestation in the uterus that commenced before the intestate's death and survives the intestate for at least 30 days after birth.\n        (2) The rules stated in subsection (1) are not to be applied if, as a result of their application, the intestate estate would pass to the State.\n\n9. General limitation of non-spousal entitlements\n        (1) A person is not entitled to participate in the distribution of an intestate estate unless the person survives the intestate.\n        (2) A reference in this Act to a child, issue, relative, or issue of a relative, of an intestate is limited to a person of the relevant description whose entitlement to share in the distribution of the intestate estate is not excluded under subsection (1) .\n\n10. Adoption\n    An adopted child is to be regarded, for the purposes of distribution on an intestacy, as a child of the adoptive parent or parents and –\n            (a) the child's family relationships are to be determined accordingly; and\n            (b) family relationships that exist as a matter of biological fact, and are not consistent with the relationship created by adoption, are to be ignored.\n\nPART 2 - Spouse's Entitlements\n\n        Note\n    In the case of an Indigenous estate, this Part is subject to exclusion or modification by a distribution order under Part 4 .\n\nDivision 1 - Entitlement of surviving spouse\n\n11. Application of this Division\n    This Division applies where the intestate leaves a spouse (but not more than one spouse).\n\n12. Spouse's entitlement where there are no issue\n    If an intestate leaves a spouse but no issue, the spouse is entitled to the whole of the intestate estate.\n\n13. Spouse's entitlement where issue are also issue of the spouse\n    If an intestate leaves a spouse and issue and the issue are all also issue of the spouse, the spouse is entitled to the whole of the intestate estate.\n\n14. Spouse's entitlement where at least one issue is not issue of the spouse\n    If an intestate leaves a spouse and any issue who are not issue of the spouse, the spouse is entitled to –\n            (a) the intestate's personal effects; and\n            (b) a statutory legacy; and\n            (c) one-half of the remainder (if any) of the intestate estate.\n\nDivision 2 - Spouse's preferential right to acquire property from the estate\n\n15. Application of this Division\n    This Division applies where the intestate leaves a spouse (but not more than one spouse).\n\n16. Spouse's right of election\n        (1) A spouse is entitled to elect to acquire property from an intestate estate.\n        (2) A spouse's election to acquire property from an intestate estate requires the Court's authorisation if –\n                (a) the property forms part of a larger aggregate; and\n                (b) the acquisition could substantially diminish the value of the remainder of the property or make the administration of the estate substantially more difficult.\n                Note: For example –  (a) the acquisition of a single item from a collection of items might substantially diminish the value of the remainder of the collection or make it substantially more difficult to dispose of the remainder of the collection; or  (b) the acquisition of the farmhouse from a farming property might substantially diminish the value of the remainder of the farming property or make it substantially more difficult to dispose of.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                \n            (3) The Court may grant an authorisation under subsection (2) and may impose such conditions as it considers just and equitable to address the matters referred to in that subsection, including a condition that the spouse pay compensation to the estate in addition to consideration to be given for the property under this Division and a condition as to costs.\n            (4) The Court must refuse authorisation if it considers that the matters referred to in subsection (2) cannot be adequately addressed by granting an authorisation subject to such conditions.\n            (5) A spouse is not entitled to elect to acquire property from an intestate estate if the transfer or conveyance by the personal representative to the spouse of the interest of the intestate in the property would require compliance with provisions of any other Act, unless those provisions would be complied with and the costs of complying with the provisions are paid by the spouse.\n            (6) A spouse who is a personal representative of the intestate is not prevented from making an election to acquire property from the intestate estate by the fact that the spouse is a trustee of the intestate estate.\n            (7) Nothing in this section confers on a spouse any right against a person who in good faith purchased for value from the personal representative of the intestate any property of the intestate.\n\n    17. Notice to be given to spouse of right of election\n            (1) An intestate's personal representative must, within one month of the grant of administration of the intestate estate, give notice to the intestate's spouse of the spouse's right of election stating –\n                    (a) how the right is to be exercised; and\n                    (b) the fact that the election may be subject to the Court's authorisation and the circumstances in which such an authorisation is required; and\n                    (c) that the right must be exercised within 3 months (or a longer period allowed by the Court) after the notice was given.\n            (2) Notice is not required under this section if the spouse is the personal representative, or one of the personal representatives, of the intestate.\n\n    18. Time for making election\n            (1) The election must be made –\n                    (a) if the spouse is entitled to notice of the right of election, within 3 months after the notice was given; or\n                    (b) if the spouse is the intestate's personal representative (or one of the personal representatives), within 3 months after the administration commences.\n            (2) The Court may, however, if it considers there are proper reasons for doing so, extend the time for making the election.\n            Note: The Court might, for example, extend the period for making an election if the Court's authorisation for making the election is required or if a question remains unresolved regarding the existence, or the nature, of a person's interest in the intestate estate.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n            \n                (3) The Court may extend the time for making the election whether or not the time for making the election has passed, but not after the administration of the estate has been completed.\n\n        19. How election to be made\n                (1) A spouse's election is made by written notice identifying, with reasonable particularity, the property the spouse elects to acquire.\n                (2) Except as provided by subsection (3) , the notice of election must be given –\n                        (a) to each person, apart from the spouse, who is a personal representative of the intestate; and\n                        (b) to each person, apart from the spouse, who is entitled to share in the intestate estate.\n                (3) The Court may direct that any of the persons referred to in subsection (2) need not be given the notice of election if it considers that giving the notice is unnecessary, unreasonable or impracticable in the circumstances of the case.\n                (4) A spouse who has not reached the age of majority may make an election as validly and effectively as an adult.\n                (5) A spouse may revoke his or her election at any time before the transfer of the property to the spouse.\n                (6) A revocation is made by written notice of revocation given to the same persons as the notice of election.\n\n        20. Basis of election\n                (1) The price for which a spouse may elect to acquire property from the intestate estate (the \"exercise price\") is the market value of the property as at the date of the intestate's death.\n                (2) If, however, the spouse and the holder of a mortgage, charge or encumbrance over property that the spouse has elected to acquire agree to the assumption by the spouse of the liability secured by the mortgage, charge or encumbrance, the exercise price is to be reduced by the amount of the liability (as at the date of transfer) secured by the mortgage, charge or encumbrance, but –\n                        (a) the spouse takes the property subject to the mortgage, charge or encumbrance; and\n                        (b) on the transfer of the property, the liability passes to the spouse and the estate is exonerated from it.\n                (3) The personal representative of an intestate must obtain a valuation from a land valuer of real property forming part of the intestate estate if –\n                        (a) a spouse elects to acquire the real property; or\n                        (b) a spouse asks the personal representative to obtain a valuation to enable the spouse to decide whether to elect to acquire it.\n                (4) The personal representative must give a copy of the valuation to the spouse and to the other beneficiaries entitled to share in the intestate estate.\n                (5) The requirement for a personal representative to obtain a valuation under subsection (3) may be waived with the consent of all the beneficiaries entitled to share in the intestate estate.\n\n        21. Exercise price – how satisfied\n            If a spouse elects to acquire property from the intestate estate, the exercise price is to be satisfied –\n                    (a) first from money to which the spouse is entitled from the intestate estate; and\n                    (b) if that is insufficient, from money paid by the spouse to the estate on or before the date of transfer.\n\n        22. Restriction on disposal of property from intestate estate\n                (1) The personal representative of an intestate must not dispose of property from the intestate estate (except to a spouse who has elected to acquire it) unless –\n                        (a) the personal representative is the spouse entitled to make the election; or\n                        (b) the time for exercising the election has elapsed and no election has been made; or\n                        (c) the election requires the Court's authorisation but –\n                                (i) the necessary authorisation has been refused; or\n                                (ii) the application for authorisation has been withdrawn; or\n                        (d) the spouse has notified the personal representative, in writing, that he or she does not propose to exercise the right to acquire property from the estate; or\n                        (e) sale of the property is urgently required to meet liabilities of the estate; or\n                        (f) the property is perishable or likely to decrease rapidly in value.\n                (2) A transaction entered into contrary to this section is not invalid.\n\n        Division 3 - Multiple spouses\n\n        23. Spouse's entitlement where more than one spouse but no issue\n            If an intestate leaves more than one spouse, but no issue, the spouses are entitled to the whole of the intestate estate in shares determined in accordance with this Division.\n\n        24.

Entitlement of children\n                (1) If an intestate leaves no spouse but leaves issue, the intestate's children are entitled to the whole of the intestate estate.\n                (2) If –\n                        (a) an intestate leaves –\n                                (i) a spouse or spouses; and\n                                (ii) any issue who are not also issue of a surviving spouse; and\n                        (b) a part of the estate remains after satisfying the spouse's entitlement, or the spouses' entitlements –\n                the intestate's children are entitled to the remaining part of the intestate estate.\n                (3) If no child predeceased the intestate leaving issue who survived the intestate, then –\n                        (a) if there is only one surviving child, the entitlement vests in the child; or\n                        (b) if there are 2 or more surviving children, the entitlement vests in them in equal shares.\n                (4) If one or more of the intestate's children predeceased the intestate leaving issue who survived the intestate –\n                        (a) allowance must be made in the division of the entitlement between children for the presumptive share of any such deceased child; and\n                        (b) the presumptive share of any such deceased child is to be divided between that child's children and, if any of these grandchildren (of the intestate) predeceased the intestate leaving issue who survived the intestate, the deceased grandchild's presumptive share is to be divided between the grandchild's children (again allowing for the presumptive share of a great grandchild who predeceased the intestate leaving issue who survived the intestate), and so on until the entitlement is exhausted.\n\n        29. Parents\n                (1) The parents of an intestate are entitled to the whole of the intestate estate if the intestate leaves –\n                        (a) no spouse; and\n                        (b) no issue.\n                (2) If there is only one surviving parent, the entitlement vests in the parent and, if both survive, it vests in equal shares.\n\n        30.

Grandparents\n                (1) The grandparents of an intestate are entitled to the whole of an intestate estate if the intestate leaves –\n                        (a) no spouse; and\n                        (b) no issue; and\n                        (c) no parent; and\n                        (d) no brother or sister, or issue of a deceased brother or sister.\n                (2) If there is only one surviving grandparent, the entitlement vests in the grandparent and, if 2 or more survive, it vests in equal shares.\n\n        32. Aunts and uncles\n                (1) The brothers and sisters of each of an intestate's parents are entitled to the whole of the intestate estate if the intestate leaves –\n                        (a) no spouse; and\n                        (b) no issue; and\n                        (c) no parent; and\n                        (d) no brother or sister, or issue of a deceased brother or sister; and\n                        (e) no grandparent.\n                (2) If no brother or sister of a parent of the intestate predeceased the intestate leaving a child who survived the intestate, then –\n                        (a) if only one survives, the entitlement vests in the surviving brother or sister; or\n                        (b) if 2 or more survive, the entitlement vests in them in equal shares.\n                (3) If a brother or sister of a parent of the intestate predeceased the intestate leaving a child who survived the intestate, the child is entitled to the deceased parent's presumptive share and, if there are 2 or more children, they share equally.\n\n        33. Entitlement to take in separate capacities\n            A relative may be entitled to participate in the distribution of an intestate estate in separate capacities.\n            Note: For example, suppose that an intestate dies leaving no spouse and no surviving relatives except children of a deceased maternal aunt and paternal uncle who had a child in common as well as children of other unions. In this case, the child of the union between the maternal aunt and the paternal uncle would be entitled to participate in the estate both as representative of the maternal aunt and as representative of the paternal uncle.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n            \n\n            PART 4 - Indigenous Estates\n\n            34. Application for distribution order\n                    (1) The personal representative of an Indigenous intestate, or a person claiming to be entitled to share in an intestate estate under the laws, customs, traditions and practices of the Indigenous community or group to which an Indigenous intestate belonged, may apply to the Court for an order for distribution of the intestate estate under this Part.\n                    (2) An application under this section must be accompanied by a scheme for distribution of the estate in accordance with the laws, customs, traditions and practices of the community or group to which the intestate belonged.\n                    (3) An application under this section must be made within 12 months after administration commences or a longer period allowed by the Court but no application may be made after the intestate estate has been fully distributed.\n                    (4) After a personal representative makes, or receives notice of, an application under this section, the personal representative must not distribute (or continue with the distribution of) property comprised in the estate unless –\n                            (a) the application has been determined; or\n                            (b) the Court authorises the distribution.\n\n            35. Distribution orders\n                    (1) The Court may, on an application under this Part, order that the intestate estate, or part of the intestate estate, be distributed in accordance with the terms of the order.\n                    (2) An order under this Part may require a person to whom property was distributed before the date of the application to return the property to the personal representative for distribution in accordance with the terms of the order (but no distribution that has been, or is to be, used for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of a person who was totally or partially dependent on the intestate immediately before the intestate's death can be disturbed).\n                    (3) In formulating an order under this Part, the Court must have regard to –\n                            (a) the scheme for distribution submitted by the applicant; and\n                            (b) the laws, customs, traditions and practices of the Indigenous community or group to which the intestate belonged.\n                    (4) The Court may not, however, make an order under this Part unless satisfied that the terms of the order are, in all the circumstances, just.\n\n            36. Effect of distribution order under this Part\n                A distribution order under this Part operates (subject to its terms) to the exclusion of all other provisions of this Act governing the distribution of the intestate estate.\n\n            PART 5 - Absence of Persons Entitled\n\n            37. Intestate leaving no persons entitled\n                If an intestate dies leaving no person who is entitled to the intestate estate, the State is entitled to the whole of the intestate estate.\n\n            38. State has discretion to make provision out of property to which it becomes entitled\n                    (1) If the State is entitled to an intestate estate under this Part, the Minister may, on application for a waiver of the State's rights, waive the State's rights in whole or part in favour of –\n                            (a) dependants of the intestate; or\n                            (b) any persons who have, in the Minister's opinion, a just or moral claim on the intestate; or\n                            (c) any organisation or person for whom the intestate might reasonably be expected to have made provision; or\n                            (d) the trustees for any person or organisation mentioned in paragraph (a) , (b) or (c) ; or\n                            (e) any other organisation or person.\n                    (2) The Minister may grant a waiver under this section on conditions the Minister considers appropriate.\n\n            PART 6 - Miscellaneous\n\n            39. Non-deferral of interest of minor\n                The entitlement of a minor to an interest in an intestate estate vests immediately (i.e. it is not deferred until the minor reaches majority or marries).\n\n            40. Effect of disclaimer, &c.\n                For the purposes of the distribution of an intestate estate, a person will be treated as having predeceased the intestate if the person –\n                        (a) disclaims an interest, to which he or she would otherwise be entitled, in the intestate estate; or\n                        (b) is disqualified from taking an interest in the intestate estate for any reason.\n                        Note: It follows that, if the person has issue, the issue may be entitled to take the person's presumptive share of the intestate estate by representation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                   \n                        \n\n                41. Effect of testamentary and other gifts\n                    The distribution of an intestate estate is not affected by gifts made by the intestate to beneficiaries –\n                            (a) during the intestate's lifetime; or\n                            (b) in the case of a partial intestacy, by will.\n\n                42. Administrator may cease to search for next of kin in certain circumstances\n                        (1) If the administrator of an intestate estate is of the opinion that the gross value of the estate does not exceed the amount prescribed under section 20(1) of the Public Trustee Act 1930 , the administrator may cease to search for next of kin who may be entitled under this Act to the whole or part of the estate if the administrator considers that the cost of conducting the search is likely to exhaust the whole or a substantial part of the estate.\n                        (2) Subsection (1) applies if the administrator is the Public Trustee, a trustee company, within the meaning of the Trustee Companies Act 1953 , or an Australian legal practitioner.\n\n                43. Administrator may pay funds of estate to persons where search has ceased for next of kin\n                        (1) If the administrator of an estate has exercised his or her discretion under section 42 and ceased to search for next of kin and the administrator is satisfied that there are persons whose whereabouts are known who are entitled under this Act to the whole or part of the estate, the administrator may pay the whole or part of the estate to those persons.\n                        (2) If the administrator of the estate pays part only of the funds of the estate under subsection (1) to persons who the administrator considers are entitled, the remainder of the funds of the estate is to be dealt with as unclaimed money under section 36A of the Public Trustee Act 1930 , section 32 of the Trustee Companies Act 1953 or Division 3 of Part 3.2 of Chapter 3 of the Legal Profession Act 2007 , as the case may require.\n\n                44. Where search has ceased for next of kin and no persons entitled are located\n                    If the administrator of an estate has exercised his or her discretion under section 42 and ceased to search for next of kin and section 43(1) does not apply, the estate is to be dealt with as unclaimed money under section 36A of the Public Trustee Act 1930 , section 32 of the Trustee Companies Act 1953 or Division 3 of Part 3.2 of Chapter 3 of the Legal Profession Act 2007 , as the case may require.\n\n                45. Administration of Act\n                    Until provision is made in relation to this Act by order under section 4 of the Administrative Arrangements Act 1990 –\n                            (a) the administration of this Act is assigned to the Minister for Justice; and\n                            (b) the department responsible to that Minister in relation to the administration of this Act is the Department of Justice.\n\n                46.
