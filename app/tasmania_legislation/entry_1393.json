or\n                (b) order that a sentence (in this section called the \"substituted sentence\") take effect in place of the suspended sentence; or\n                (c) by order, vary the conditions on which the execution of the sentence was suspended, including extending the period of suspension in the order to a day no later than 12 months after the day the offender was found guilty of the new offence; or\n                (d) make no order in respect of the suspended sentence.\n        (4D) If the court decides not to exercise the power referred to in subsection (4B) it must state the reasons for so deciding.\n        (4E) If, on the hearing of an application under this section, the court is satisfied that the offender has breached, without reasonable excuse, a condition of the suspended sentence other than by committing a new offence, the court may –\n                (a) activate all or part of the sentence that is held in suspense and order the offender to serve it;

or\n                (d) make no order in respect of the suspended sentence.\n        (5) A substituted sentence may be any sentence that the court could have imposed on the offender had it just found the offender guilty of the offence in respect of which the suspended sentence was imposed, but no greater term of imprisonment is to be imposed by the substituted sentence than was imposed by the suspended sentence.\n        (6) If a court orders an offender to serve a term of imprisonment that had been held in suspense, the term of imprisonment must, unless the court otherwise orders, be served –\n                (a) immediately; and\n                (b) cumulatively with any other term of imprisonment previously imposed on the offender by that court or any other court.\n        (6A) If, under subsection (4B) , (4C) or (4E) , a court orders a sentence to take effect –\n                (a) the sentence is taken to be a sentence imposed on the offender as if the court had just found the offender guilty of the offence in respect of which the suspended sentence was imposed; and\n                (b) section 17 applies to that sentence.\n        (6B) If, under subsection (4C) or (4E) , a court orders that a substituted sentence is to take effect, section 17 applies to the substituted sentence.\n        (7) If it is not possible for the court to immediately deal with an application under subsection (1) or (4) in respect of the offender, the court may –\n                (a) adjourn the proceedings;

Commission of certain offences\n        (1) If a court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an offender has failed to comply with a condition of a drug treatment order (including such an order made by another court) by committing an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding 12 months, the court must –\n                (a) take one of the actions under section 27M(1) as though the offender had failed to comply with any other condition of the order; or\n                (b) cancel the treatment and supervision part of the order and, after taking into account the extent of the offender's compliance with that part –\n                        (i) make an order activating some or all of the custodial part of the drug treatment order; or\n                        (ii) subject to subsection (2A) , cancel the custodial part of the drug treatment order and, other than by making an order under section 7(a) , deal with the offender for each offence in respect of which the drug treatment order was made in any way in which it could deal with the offender had it just found the offender guilty of each such offence.\n        (2) The court may act under subsection (1) on its own motion or on the application of –\n                (a) a police officer or prosecutor; or\n                (b) a court diversion officer.\n        (2A) A court constituted by a magistrate may only take action under subsection (1)(b)(ii) in relation to a drug treatment order if the court made the order.\n        (3) Before the court cancels the treatment and supervision part of the drug treatment order under subsection (1) , whether or not it also cancels the custodial part, it must give the offender an opportunity to make a submission on the matter.\n        (4) To avoid doubt, if under this section the court cancels the treatment and supervision part or custodial part of the drug treatment order, any earlier orders activating the custodial part of the drug treatment order cease to have effect forthwith.\n\n27P. Hearing and determining certain offences\n        (1) This section applies if an offender subject to a drug treatment order is charged with an offence, whether committed before or after the making of the order, and –\n                (a) a court finds the offender guilty of the offence; and\n                (b) for the offence, the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on the offender; and\n                (c) the court does not suspend the sentence, either in whole or in part; and\n                (d) the length of the sentence is less than the remaining length of the custodial part of the drug treatment order; and\n                (e) the offence is one for which the court could have made a drug treatment order if the offender were not already subject to such an order.\n        (2) The court, in imposing the sentence, may order that it is subsumed within the custodial part of the drug treatment order.\n        (3) However, unless subsection (2) applies, the court must cancel the treatment and supervision part of the drug treatment order under paragraph (b) of section 27O(1) and take an action under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of that paragraph.\n        (4) Despite subsection (3) , a court constituted by a magistrate may only take, in accordance with that subsection, an action under section 27O(1)(b)(ii) in relation to a drug treatment order if the court made the order.\n\n27Q. Cancellation\n        (1) A court may cancel the treatment and supervision part of a drug treatment order made by the court if it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that –\n                (a) before the order was made, the offender's circumstances were not accurately presented to the court or the authors of the relevant drug treatment order assessment report; or\n                (b) the offender will be unable to comply with a condition of the order because his or her circumstances have materially changed since it was made; or\n                (c) the offender is no longer willing to comply with one or more conditions of the order; or\n                (d) the continuation of the treatment and supervision part of the order is unlikely to achieve one or more of the purposes for which the order was made.\n        (2) When cancelling the treatment and supervision part of the order under subsection (1) , the court, after taking into account the extent of the offender's compliance with that part, must –\n                (a) make an order activating some or all of the custodial part of the drug treatment order; or\n                (b) cancel the custodial part of the drug treatment order and, other than by making an order under section 7(a) , deal with the offender for each offence in respect of which the drug treatment order was made in any way in which it could deal with the offender had it just convicted him or her of each such offence.\n        (3) The court may act under subsection (1) or (2) on its own motion or on the application of –\n                (a) the offender; or\n                (b) a police officer or prosecutor; or\n                (c) a court diversion officer.\n        (4) Before the court cancels the treatment and supervision part of the drug treatment order, whether or not it also cancels the custodial part, it must give the offender an opportunity to make a submission on the matter.\n        (5) When making an order under subsection (2)(a) , the court may fix a non-parole period for the sentence of imprisonment, or partial sentence of imprisonment, activated by the order.\n        (6) Subsection (5) has effect notwithstanding any other provision of this Part.\n        (7) To avoid doubt, if under this section the court cancels the treatment and supervision part or custodial part of the drug treatment order, any earlier orders activating the custodial part of the drug treatment order cease to have effect forthwith.\n\n27QA. Referral of matters to other courts\n        (1) Despite any other provision of this or any other Act, if –\n                (a) a drug treatment order that is in force in relation to an offender has been made by a court constituted by a magistrate, by the Supreme Court or by the Court of Criminal Appeal; and\n                (b) the offender is before the Supreme Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal –\n        the Supreme Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal, as the case may be, may, if it is of the opinion that a court constituted by a magistrate ought to consider whether to deal with the offender under a provision of this Part, remand the offender on bail, or in custody, to appear before a court constituted by a magistrate.\n        (2) Despite any other provision of this or any other Act, if –\n                (a) a drug treatment order that is in force in relation to an offender has been made by the Supreme Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal; and\n                (b) the offender is before a court constituted by a magistrate –\n        the court constituted by a magistrate may, if it is of the opinion that the Supreme Court ought to consider whether to deal with the offender under a provision of this Part, remand the offender on bail, or in custody, to appear before the Supreme Court.\n        (3) If an offender is remanded by a court (the transferring court) to appear before another court (the receiving court) in accordance with this section –\n                (a) the receiving court is to consider whether to deal with the offender under a provision of this Part; and\n                (b) if the receiving court considers that –\n                        (i) it ought to deal with the offender under a provision of this Part, the receiving court may take any action in relation to the offender that it may take under the provision; or\n                        (ii) it is not appropriate for the offender to be dealt with by the receiving court, the receiving court may remand the offender on bail, or in custody, to appear before the transferring court to be dealt with as if the offender had not been remanded to appear before the receiving court.\n        (4) Without limiting the generality of subsection (3)(b)(i) , the action that a receiving court may take under subsection (3)(b)(i) includes, if an application to the transferring court in relation to the offender has not been disposed of by the transferring court, any action that the receiving court could take if the application had been made to the receiving court.\n\n27R. Second anniversary review\n        (1) This section applies if the treatment and supervision part of a drug treatment order is not cancelled under section 27L , 27O or 27Q within the 2-year period immediately following the making of the order.\n        (2) As soon as practicable after the 2-year period, a court constituted by a magistrate must review the treatment and supervision part to determine whether, notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, it should continue to operate.\n        (3) The court may conduct the review in the same manner as a case conference convened under section 27I and, if it does so, subsections (2) , (3) and (4) of that section apply, with necessary modifications, to the review.\n        (4) On completion of a review in relation to a drug treatment order, the court must –\n                (a) if the court that made the order was constituted by a magistrate, cancel the treatment and supervision part of the order and exercise the court's powers under section 27Q(2) ; or\n                (b) if the Supreme Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal made the order, provide to the court that made the order a report in relation to the review.\n        (5) A court that is provided under subsection (4)(b) with a report in relation to an order must cancel the treatment and supervision part of the order and exercise the court's powers under section 27Q(2) .\n\n27S. Motions to review\n        (1) On the hearing of a motion to review a sentencing order made by a court constituted by a magistrate, the Supreme Court may itself make a drug treatment order.\n        (2) For a sentencing order made by a court constituted by a magistrate, Part XI of the Justices Act 1959 applies with the following modifications:\n                (a) a motion to review does not lie against –\n                        (i) a refusal to make a drug treatment order; or\n                        (ii) a finding that an offender has failed to comply with a condition of a drug treatment order; or\n                        (iii) the variation of the treatment and supervision part of a drug treatment order; or\n                        (iv) the cancellation of the treatment and supervision part, or the custodial part, of a drug treatment order;\n                (b) if a motion to review concerns the custodial part of a drug treatment order, and not its treatment and supervision part, the motion does not operate as a stay of the treatment and supervision part of the order unless the Supreme Court so orders.\n        (3) For the purposes of section 7 , an order under this Part activating some or all of the custodial part of a drug treatment order is taken to be a sentencing order.\n        (4) If, on the hearing of a motion to review a sentencing order made by a court constituted by a magistrate, the Supreme Court considers that the making of a drug treatment order may be appropriate, it may make such an order under this Part or, with or without directions, refer the matter to that court to consider the making of such an order.\n        (5) If a court to which a matter is referred under subsection (4) determines not to make a drug treatment order, it must remit the matter to the Supreme Court for the making of an order under section 7 .\n        (6) If a court to which a matter is referred under subsection (4) makes a drug treatment order –\n                (a) the order has effect for section 7 as if it were a sentencing order made by the Supreme Court on the hearing of the motion to review; but\n                (b) for all other purposes has effect as an order made by a magistrate.\n\n27T. Immunity from prosecution for certain drug offences\n        (1) A person is not liable to be prosecuted for an offence involving controlled drugs within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act 2001 –\n                (a) as a result of any admission made in connection with any assessment of the eligibility of the person for the making of a drug treatment order; or\n                (b) as a result of any admission made in connection with the assessment by a court, or at a case conference convened by that court under section 27I , of the person's progress under a drug treatment order.\n        (2) However, subsection (1) does not prevent a prosecution for any offence involving controlled drugs within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act 2001 if there is evidence, other than the admission or evidence obtained as a result of the admission, to support a charge.\n        (3) The admission, and any evidence obtained as a result of the admission, is not admissible against the person in a prosecution referred to in subsection (2) .\n\n27U.

Attendance at educational program\n    If an offender who is subject to a community service order attends an educational or other program in accordance with the directions of a probation officer, the time that the offender spends attending that program is taken to be performance of community service under the order.\n\n33.

Enforcement of fine by civil process\n        (1) If an offender who has been ordered by a court to pay a fine is in default in payment of that fine, the fine is taken to be a judgment of the Magistrates Court (Civil Division) and enforceable under the Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Act 1992 .\n        (2) An action to enforce the fine under the Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Act 1992 pursuant to this section does not preclude action being taken or continued under section 47 or the Monetary Penalties Enforcement Act 2005 against the offender in default.\n\n54.\n. . . . . . . .\n\nPART 6A - Rehabilitation programs\n\n54A.
