This subsidiary hazard is the other UN Class/es or UN Division/s to which the goods also belong. Under the ADG Code, if particular dangerous goods are listed in the Dangerous Goods List, their subsidiary hazard is that listed in column 4 of that list opposite the name and description of those goods unless Chapter 3.3 of that Code provides for those goods to be assigned a different subsidiary hazard.\n\n        34. Packing Groups\n            The Packing Group, if any, of a particular dangerous good for the purposes of these regulations is –\n                    (a) if a determination is in force under regulation 22(1)(d) that the good is of a particular Packing Group, the Packing Group specified in the determination; or\n                    (b) if no such determination is in effect, the Packing Group determined for the good in accordance with the ADG Code.\n\n                    Note\n                The assignment of particular dangerous goods to a Packing Group indicates the degree of danger of, and the level of containment required for, the goods. The Packing Group of a substance can be determined from the Dangerous Goods List, although in some cases it is also necessary to refer to Chapter 3.3 of the ADG Code.\n\n        35. Incompatibility\n                (1) Dangerous or other goods are incompatible with dangerous goods if –\n                        (a) the goods are incompatible under Chapter 9.1 of the ADG Code; or\n                        (b) the goods are determined under regulation 22(1)(e) to be incompatible with the dangerous goods; or\n                        (c) when the goods are mixed, or otherwise brought into contact, with the dangerous goods, the Competent Authority considers the goods are likely to interact with the dangerous goods and increase risk because of the interaction.\n                (2) Packaging or equipment for use in the transport of dangerous goods is incompatible with the goods if any component of the packaging or equipment that is intended or likely to come into contact with the goods during transport –\n                        (a) is likely to interact with the goods and increase risk because of the interaction; and\n                        (b) is not protected from contact under foreseeable circumstances by a protective coating or other effective means.\n\n        PART 3 - Transport of Dangerous Goods to Which Special Provisions Apply\n\n        36. Application of Part\n            This Part applies to the transport of dangerous goods if –\n                    (a) a special provision applies to the dangerous goods in the Dangerous Goods List; and\n                    (b) that provision prohibits the transport of the goods by road or rail, or imposes a restriction on the way the goods are to be transported by road or rail.\n\n                    Note\n                Column 6 of the Dangerous Goods List specifies whether a special provision applies to dangerous goods and Part 3.3 of the ADG Code lists the special provisions that apply.\n\n        37.
