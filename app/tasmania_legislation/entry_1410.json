Compensation\n                    (1) A property owner is to compensate a tenant if the owner –\n                            (a) inhibits access of the tenant to the premises rented by the tenant in any substantial manner; or\n                            (b) takes any action, other than action required under any legislation that would substantially alter or inhibit the flow of customers to the premises; or\n                            (c) causes, or fails to make reasonable efforts to prevent or remove, anything which adversely affects the tenant's trading; or\n                            (d) fails to have rectified as soon as practicable any breakdown of plant or equipment –\n                                    (i) which is under the property owner's care and maintenance; and\n                                    (ii) the breakdown of which causes a loss of profits to the tenant; or\n                            (e) acts in a manner which, in all the circumstances, is unconscionable; or\n                            (f) terminates a lease dishonestly, maliciously or for a purpose that is not genuine; or\n                            (g) in relation to a shopping centre, fails to take reasonable steps to ensure the cleaning, maintenance or repair of the shopping centre, including any common area; or\n                            (h) fails to take reasonable steps to ensure the premises are kept in good order and repair; or\n                            (i) relocates the tenant's business to other premises during the term of the lease or any renewal of it; or\n                            (j) fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that any defect in the shopping centre or retail premises is rectified; or\n                            (k) causes the tenant to vacate the premises before the end of the lease or any renewal of it because of any extensions, refurbishment or demolition.\n                    (2) A lease is not to limit liability for compensation in the circumstances referred to in subclause (1)(a) , (b) , (c) , (d) or (g) unless –\n                            (a) before the execution of the lease, the property owner brings the specific disturbance to the tenant's quiet enjoyment during the term or currency of the lease to the tenant's attention; and\n                            (b) there is a clause in the lease that specifies a formula for compensation in the event of that specific disturbance occurring.\n                    (3) A provision in a lease that purports to limit liability for compensation under subclause (1)(e) or (f) is invalid.\n                    (4) The enlargement of a shopping centre or a change in its tenancy is not, of itself, a ground for compensation.\n            24. Demolition\n                    (1) If a lease provides for termination on the grounds of intended demolition, a demolition clause is not to be invoked unless the property owner produces to the tenant firm proposals for the demolition which affect the tenancy concerned.\n                    (2) A property owner is to give a tenant at least 6 months' written notice of the termination of a lease on the grounds of intended demolition.\n                    (3) If a property owner gives written notice of termination to a tenant under a demolition clause, the tenant may terminate the lease on one month's written notice to the property owner.\n                    (4) The tenant may give notice of the termination of a lease at any time within 6 months before the termination date notified by the property owner.\n            25. Damaged premises\n                    (1) A tenant is not required to pay rent and outgoings if the premises rented by the tenant are unuseable for the purposes described in the lease or inaccessible due to damage unless the tenant –\n                            (a) is responsible for the damage; or\n                            (b) contributes substantially to the damage; or\n                            (c) takes some action which results in the termination of the property owner's insurance policy.\n                    (2) If premises that are damaged are useable for the purposes described in the lease, the rent and outgoings are to be reduced having regard to the nature and extent of the damage.\n                    (3) If, after a written request from a tenant, a property owner fails to repair, within a reasonable time, premises that are damaged so as to be unuseable for the purposes described in the lease or that are inaccessible due to damage, the tenant, in addition to any other rights, may terminate the lease.\n            26. Employment restriction\n                    (1) Subject to subclause (2) , a lease is not to limit a tenant's freedom to employ contractors or staff.\n                    (2) A lease may do one or more of the following:\n                            (a) specify minimum standards of competence;\n                            (b) prohibit work from being carried out on or to specified items of the property owner's property;\n                            (c) require tenants to conform with any construction site agreement or other industrial award affecting the shopping centre;\n                            (d) require work carried out by or on behalf of the tenant to be in accordance with the law.\n            27. Refurbishment of premises\n                If a lease states the general form and timing of the refurbishment or refitting of premises, a property owner may require a tenant to refurbish or refit the premises.\n            28.
