Tort of defamation\n        (1) This Act relates to the tort of defamation at general law.\n        (2) This Act does not affect the operation of the general law in relation to the tort of defamation except to the extent that this Act provides otherwise (whether expressly or by necessary implication).\n        (3) Without limiting subsection (2) , the general law as it is from time to time applies for the purposes of this Act as if the Defamation Act 1957 had never been enacted.\n\n7. Distinction between slander and libel abolished\n        (1) The distinction at general law between slander and libel remains abolished.\n        (2) Accordingly, the publication of defamatory matter of any kind is actionable without proof of special damage.\n\nDivision 2 - Causes of action for defamation\n\n8. Single cause of action for multiple defamatory imputations in same matter\n    A person has a single cause of action for defamation in relation to the publication of defamatory matter about the person even if more than one defamatory imputation about the person is carried by the matter.\n\n9. Certain corporations do not have cause of action for defamation\n        (1) A corporation has no cause of action for defamation in relation to the publication of defamatory matter about the corporation unless it was an excluded corporation at the time of the publication.\n        (2) A corporation is an excluded corporation if –\n                (a) the objects for which it is formed do not include obtaining financial gain for its members or corporators; or\n                (b) it has fewer than 10 employees and is not an associated entity of another corporation –\n        and the corporation is not a public body.\n        (3) In counting employees for the purposes of subsection (2)(b) , part-time employees are to be taken into account as an appropriate fraction of a full-time equivalent.\n        (4) . . . . . . . .\n        (5) Subsection (1) does not affect any cause of action for defamation that an individual associated with a corporation has in relation to the publication of defamatory matter about the individual even if the publication of the same matter also defames the corporation.\n        (6) In this section –\n            corporation includes any body corporate or corporation constituted by or under a law of any country (including by exercise of a prerogative right), whether or not a public body;\n            employee, in relation to a corporation, includes any individual (whether or not an independent contractor) who is –\n                    (a) engaged in the day to day operations of the corporation other than as a volunteer; and\n                    (b) subject to the control and direction of the corporation;\n            public body means a local government body or other governmental or public authority constituted by or under a law of any country.\n\n10. No cause of action for defamation of, or against, deceased persons\n        (1) A person (including a personal representative of a deceased person) cannot assert, continue or enforce a cause of action for defamation in relation to –\n                (a) the publication of defamatory matter about a deceased person (whether published before or after that persons death); or\n                (b) the publication of defamatory matter by a person who has died since publishing the matter.\n        (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a court, if it considers it in the interests of justice to do so, from determining the question of costs for proceedings discontinued because of the subsection.\n\n10A. Serious harm element of cause of action for defamation\n        (1) It is an element (the serious harm element) of a cause of action for defamation that the publication of defamatory matter about a person has caused, or is likely to cause, serious harm to the reputation of the person.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) , harm to the reputation of an excluded corporation is not serious harm unless it has caused, or is likely to cause, the corporation serious financial loss.\n        (3) The judicial officer (and not the jury) in defamation proceedings is to determine whether the serious harm element is established.\n        (4) Without limiting subsection (3) , the judicial officer may (whether on the application of a party or on the judicial officers own motion) –\n                (a) determine whether the serious harm element is established at any time before the trial for the proceedings commences or during the trial; and\n                (b) make any orders the judicial officer considers appropriate concerning the determination of the issue (including dismissing the proceedings if satisfied the element is not established).\n        (5) If a party applies for the serious harm element to be determined before the trial for the proceedings commences, the judicial officer is to determine the issue as soon as practicable before the trial commences unless satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying the postponement of the determination to a later stage of the proceedings (including during the trial).\n        (6) The matters a judicial officer may take into account in deciding whether there are special circumstances for the purposes of subsection (5) include (but are not limited to) the following:\n                (a) the cost implications for the parties;\n                (b) the resources available to the court at the time;\n                (c) the extent to which establishing the serious harm element is linked to other issues for determination during the trial for the proceedings.\n        (7) Without limiting subsection (5) , the judicial officer may determine the serious harm element is not established on the pleadings without the need for further evidence if satisfied that the pleaded particulars are insufficient to establish the element.\n        (8) Nothing in this section limits the powers that a judicial officer may have apart from this section to dismiss defamation proceedings (whether before or after the trial commences).\n\nDivision 3 - Choice of law\n\n11. Choice of law for defamation proceedings\n        (1) If a matter is published wholly within a particular Australian jurisdictional area, the substantive law that is applicable in that area must be applied in this jurisdiction to determine any cause of action for defamation based on the publication.\n        (2) If there is a multiple publication of matter in more than one Australian jurisdictional area, the substantive law applicable in the Australian jurisdictional area with which the harm occasioned by the publication as a whole has its closest connection must be applied in this jurisdiction to determine each cause of action for defamation based on the publication.\n        (3) In determining the Australian jurisdictional area with which the harm occasioned by a publication of matter has its closest connection, a court may take into account –\n                (a) the place at the time of publication where the plaintiff was ordinarily resident or, in the case of a corporation that may assert a cause of action for defamation, the place where the corporation had its principal place of business at that time; and\n                (b) the extent of publication in each relevant Australian jurisdictional area; and\n                (c) the extent of harm sustained by the plaintiff in each relevant Australian jurisdictional area; and\n                (d) any other matter that the court considers relevant.\n        (4) For the purposes of this section, the substantive law applicable in an Australian jurisdictional area does not include any law prescribing rules for choice of law that differ from the rules prescribed by this section.\n        (5) In this section –\n            Australian jurisdictional area means –\n                    (a) the geographical area of Australia that lies within the territorial limits of a particular State (including its coastal waters), but not including any territory, place or other area referred to in paragraph (c) ; or\n                    (b) the geographical area of Australia that lies within the territorial limits of a particular Territory (including its coastal waters), but not including any territory, place or other area referred to in paragraph (c) ; or\n                    (c) any territory, place or other geographical area of Australia over which the Commonwealth has legislative competence but over which no State or Territory has legislative competence;\n            geographical area of Australia includes –\n                    (a) the territorial sea of Australia; and\n                    (b) the external Territories of the Commonwealth;\n            multiple publication means publication by a particular person of the same, or substantially the same, matter in substantially the same form to 2 or more persons.\n\nPART 3 - Resolution of civil disputes without litigation\n\nDivision 1 - Concerns notices and offers to make amends\n\n12. Application of Division\n        (1) This Division applies if a person (the \"publisher\") publishes matter (the \"matter in question\") that is, or may be, defamatory of another person (the \"aggrieved person\").\n        (2) The provisions of this Division may be used instead of the provisions of any rules of court or any other law in relation to payment into court or offers of compromise.\n        (3) Nothing in this Division prevents a publisher or aggrieved person from making or accepting a settlement offer in relation to the publication of the matter in question otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Division.\n\n12A. Concerns notices\n        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a notice is a concerns notice if –\n                (a) the notice –\n                        (i) is in writing; and\n                        (ii) specifies the location where the matter in question can be accessed (for example, a webpage address); and\n                        (iii) informs the publisher of the defamatory imputations that the aggrieved person considers are or may be carried about the aggrieved person by the matter in question (the imputations of concern); and\n                        (iv) informs the publisher of the harm that the aggrieved person considers to be serious harm to the persons reputation caused, or likely to be caused, by the publication of the matter in question; and\n                        (v) for an aggrieved person that is an excluded corporation – also informs the publisher of the financial loss that the corporation considers to be serious financial loss caused, or likely to be caused, by the publication of the matter in question; and\n                (b) a copy of the matter in question is, if practicable, provided to the publisher together with the notice.\n        (2) For the avoidance of doubt, a document that is required to be filed or lodged to commence defamation proceedings cannot be used as a concerns notice.\n        (3) If a concerns notice fails to particularise adequately any of the information required by subsection (1)(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) , the publisher may give the aggrieved person a written notice (a further particulars notice) requesting that the aggrieved person provide reasonable further particulars as specified in the further particulars notice about the information concerned.\n        (4) An aggrieved person to whom a further particulars notice is given must provide the reasonable further particulars specified in the notice within 14 days (or any further period agreed by the publisher and aggrieved person) after being given the notice.\n        (5) An aggrieved person who fails to provide the reasonable further particulars specified in a further particulars notice within the applicable period is taken not to have given the publisher a concerns notice under this section.\n\n12B. Defamation proceedings cannot be commenced without concerns notice\n        (1) An aggrieved person cannot commence defamation proceedings unless –\n                (a) the person has given the proposed defendant a concerns notice in respect of the matter concerned; and\n                (b) the imputations to be relied on by the person in the proposed proceedings were particularised in the concerns notice; and\n                (c) the applicable period for an offer to make amends has elapsed.\n        (2) Subsection (1)(b) does not prevent reliance on –\n                (a) some, but not all, of the imputations particularised in a concerns notice; or\n                (b) imputations that are substantially the same as those particularised in a concerns notice.\n        (3) The court may grant leave for proceedings to be commenced despite non-compliance with subsection (1)(c) , but only if the proposed plaintiff satisfies the court that –\n                (a) the commencement of proceedings after the end of the applicable period for an offer to make amends contravenes the limitation law; or\n                (b) it is just and reasonable to grant leave.\n        (4) The commencement of proceedings contravenes the limitation law for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) if the proceedings could not be commenced after the end of the applicable period for an offer to make amends because the court will have ceased to have power to extend the limitation period.\n        (5) In this section –\n            limitation law, in relation to proceedings, means the provisions of Tasmanian law that apply in respect of the limitation periods in relation to the proceedings.\n\n13. Publisher may make offer to make amends\n        (1) The publisher may make an offer to make amends to the aggrieved person.\n        (2) The offer may be –\n                (a) in relation to the matter in question generally; or\n                (b) limited to any particular defamatory imputations that the publisher accepts that the matter in question carries.\n        (3) If 2 or more persons published the matter in question, an offer to make amends by one or more of them does not affect the liability of the other or others.\n        (4) An offer to make amends is taken to have been made without prejudice, unless the offer provides otherwise.\n\n14. When offer to make amends may be made\n        (1) An offer to make amends cannot be made if –\n                (a) the applicable period for an offer to make amends has expired; or\n                (b) a defence has been served in an action brought by the aggrieved person against the publisher in relation to the matter in question.\n        (2) For the purposes of this Act, the applicable period for an offer to make amends is –\n                (a) if the aggrieved person has provided further particulars in response to a further particulars notice about a concerns notice after 14 days have elapsed since the concerns notice was given – 14 days since the publisher was given the further particulars; or\n                (b) in any other case – 28 days since the publisher was given a concerns notice by the aggrieved person.\n        (3) If a publisher gives more than one further particulars notice, subsection (2)(a) applies only in respect of the first notice.\n        (4) . . . . . . . .\n        (5) . . . . . . . .\n\n15.

Withdrawal of offer to make amends\n        (1) An offer to make amends may be withdrawn before it is accepted, by notice in writing given to the aggrieved person.\n        (2) A publisher who has withdrawn an offer to make amends may make a renewed offer.\n        (3) A renewed offer may (but need not) be in the same terms as the withdrawn offer.\n        (4) A renewed offer is to be treated as a new offer (including for the purposes of section 14 ).\n        (5) However, the time limit specified in section 14 for the making of offers to make amends does not prevent the making of a renewed offer that is not in the same terms as the withdrawn offer if –\n                (a) the renewed offer represents a genuine attempt by the publisher to address matters of concern raised by the aggrieved person about the withdrawn offer; and\n                (b) the renewed offer is made within 14 days after the withdrawal of the withdrawn offer or any other period agreed by the publisher and the aggrieved person.\n\n17. Effect of acceptance of offer to make amends\n        (1) If the publisher carries out the terms of an offer to make amends (including payment of any compensation under the offer) that is accepted, the aggrieved person cannot assert, continue or enforce an action for defamation against the publisher in relation to the matter in question even if the offer was limited to any particular defamatory imputations.\n        (2) A court may (but need not) –\n                (a) order the publisher to pay the aggrieved person the expenses reasonably incurred by the aggrieved person as a result of accepting the offer; and\n                (b) order any costs incurred by the aggrieved person that form part of those expenses to be assessed on an indemnity basis.\n        (3) The powers conferred on a court by subsection (2) are exercisable –\n                (a) if the aggrieved person has brought proceedings against the publisher in any court for defamation in relation to the matter in question, by that court in those proceedings; and\n                (b) except as provided in paragraph (a) , by the Supreme Court.\n\n18. Effect of failure to accept reasonable offer to make amends\n        (1) If an offer to make amends is made in relation to the matter in question but is not accepted, it is a defence to an action for defamation against the publisher in relation to the matter if –\n                (a) the publisher made the offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the publisher was given a concerns notice in respect of the matter (and, in any event, within the applicable period for an offer to make amends); and\n                (b) the publisher was ready and willing, on acceptance of the offer by the aggrieved person, to carry out the terms of the offer; and\n                (c) in all the circumstances the offer was reasonable.\n        (2) In determining whether an offer to make amends is reasonable, a court –\n                (a) must have regard to any correction or apology published before any trial arising out of the matter in question, including the extent to which the correction or apology is brought to the attention of the audience of the matter in question taking into account –\n                        (i) the prominence given to the correction or apology as published in comparison to the prominence given to the matter in question as published; and\n                        (ii) the period that elapses between publication of the matter in question and publication of the correction or apology; and\n                (b) may have regard to –\n                        (i) whether the aggrieved person refused to accept an offer that was limited to any particular defamatory imputations because the aggrieved person did not agree with the publisher about the imputations that the matter in question carried; and\n                        (ii) any other matter that the court considers relevant.\n        (3) Despite section 22(2) , the judicial officer (and not the jury) in defamation proceedings tried by jury is to determine whether a defence under this section is established.\n\n19. Inadmissibility of evidence of certain statements and admissions\n        (1) Evidence of any statement or admission made in connection with the making or acceptance of an offer to make amends is not admissible as evidence in any legal proceedings (whether criminal or civil).\n        (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the admission of evidence in any legal proceedings in order to determine –\n                (a) any issue arising under, or relating to the application of, a provision of this Division; or\n                (b) costs in defamation proceedings.\n\nDivision 2 - Apologies\n\n20. Effect of apology on liability for defamation\n        (1) An apology made by or on behalf of a person in connection with any defamatory matter alleged to have been published by the person –\n                (a) does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability by the person in connection with that matter; and\n                (b) is not relevant to the determination of fault or liability in connection with that matter.\n        (2) Evidence of an apology made by or on behalf of a person in connection with any defamatory matter alleged to have been published by the person is not admissible in any civil proceedings as evidence of the fault or liability of the person in connection with that matter.\n        (3) Nothing in this section limits the operation of section 38 .\n\nPART 4 - Litigation of civil disputes\n\nDivision 1 - General\n\n20A. Proceedings generally to be commenced within one year\n        (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, an action on a cause of action for defamation is not maintainable if brought after the end of a limitation period of one year running from the date of the publication of the matter complained of.\n        (2) The limitation period referred to in subsection (1) is taken to have been extended as provided by subsection (3) if a concerns notice is given to the proposed defendant on a day (the notice day) within the period of 56 days before the limitation period expires.\n        (3) The limitation period referred to in subsection (1) is extended for an additional period of 56 days, minus any days remaining after the notice day until the limitation period was to expire under subsection (1) .\n        (4) In this section –\n            date of the publication, in relation to the publication of a matter in electronic form, means the day on which the matter was first uploaded for access or sent electronically to a recipient.\n\n20AB.

Scope of defences under general law and other law not limited\n        (1) A defence under this Division is additional to any other defence or exclusion of liability available to the defendant apart from this Act (including under the general law) and does not of itself vitiate, limit or abrogate any other defence or exclusion of liability.\n        (2) If a defence under this Division to the publication of defamatory matter may be defeated by proof that the publication was actuated by malice, the general law applies in defamation proceedings in which the defence is raised to determine whether a particular publication of matter was actuated by malice.\n\n25.

Defence of fair report of proceedings of public concern\n        (1) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the matter was, or was contained in, a fair report of any proceedings of public concern.\n        (2) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the matter was, or was contained in, an earlier published report of proceedings of public concern; and\n                (b) the matter was, or was contained in, a fair copy of, a fair summary of, or a fair extract from, the earlier published report; and\n                (c) the defendant had no knowledge that would reasonably make the defendant aware that the earlier published report was not fair.\n        (3) A defence established under subsection (1) or (2) is defeated if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the defamatory matter was not published honestly for the information of the public or the advancement of education.\n        (4) In this section –\n            proceedings of public concern means –\n                    (a) any proceedings in public of a parliamentary body;

Defence of qualified privilege for provision of certain information\n        (1) There is a defence of qualified privilege for the publication of defamatory matter to a person (the \"recipient\") if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the recipient has an interest or apparent interest in having information on some subject; and\n                (b) the matter is published to the recipient in the course of giving to the recipient information on that subject; and\n                (c) the conduct of the defendant in publishing that matter is reasonable in the circumstances.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) , a recipient has an apparent interest in having information on some subject if, and only if, at the time of the publication in question, the defendant believes on reasonable grounds that the recipient has that interest.\n        (3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1) whether the conduct of the defendant in publishing matter about a person is reasonable in the circumstances, a court may take into account the following factors to the extent the court considers them applicable in the circumstances:\n                (a) the seriousness of any defamatory imputation carried by the matter published;\n                (b) the extent to which the matter published distinguishes between suspicions, allegations and proven facts;\n                (c) the nature of the business environment in which the defendant operates;\n                (d) whether it was appropriate in the circumstances for the matter to be published expeditiously;\n                (e) any other steps taken to verify the information in the matter published.\n                (f) . . . . . . . .\n                (g) . . . . . . . .\n                (h) . . . . . . . .\n                (i) . . . . . . . .\n                (j) . . . . . . . .\n        (3A) Subsection (3) does not –\n                (a) require each factor referred to in the subsection to be taken into account; or\n                (b) limit the matters that the court may take into account.\n        (3B) It is not necessary to prove that the matter published concerned an issue of public interest to establish the defence of qualified privilege under subsection (1) .\n        (4) For the avoidance of doubt, a defence of qualified privilege under subsection (1) is defeated if the plaintiff proves that the publication of the defamatory matter was actuated by malice.\n        (5) However, a defence of qualified privilege under subsection (1) is not defeated merely because the defamatory matter was published for reward.\n        (6) Without affecting the application of section 22 to other defences, the jury (and not the judicial officer) in defamation proceedings tried by jury is to determine whether a defence under this section is established.\n\n30A. Defence of scientific or academic peer review\n        (1) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the matter was published in a scientific or academic journal (whether published in electronic form or otherwise); and\n                (b) the matter relates to a scientific or academic issue; and\n                (c) an independent review of the matters scientific or academic merit was carried out before the matter was published in the journal by –\n                        (i) the editor of the journal if the editor has expertise in the scientific or academic issue concerned; or\n                        (ii) one or more persons with expertise in the scientific or academic issue concerned.\n        (2) If there is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter in a scientific or academic journal because of subsection (1) , there is also a defence to the publication of any assessment of the matter in the same journal if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the assessment was written by one or more of the persons who carried out the independent review of the matter; and\n                (b) the assessment was written in the course of that review.\n        (3) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the matter was contained in a fair summary of, or fair extract from, a matter or assessment for which there is a defence because of subsection (1) or (2) .\n        (4) If a journal has more than one editor, a reference in this section to the editor of the journal is to be read as a reference to the editor or editors who were responsible for deciding to publish the matter concerned.\n        (5) A defence established under this section is defeated if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the defamatory matter or assessment was not published honestly for the information of the public or the advancement of education.\n\n31. Defences of honest opinion\n        (1) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the matter was an expression of opinion of the defendant rather than a statement of fact; and\n                (b) the opinion related to a matter of public interest; and\n                (c) the opinion is based on proper material.\n        (2) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the matter was an expression of opinion of an employee or agent of the defendant rather than a statement of fact; and\n                (b) the opinion related to a matter of public interest; and\n                (c) the opinion is based on proper material.\n        (3) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the matter was an expression of opinion of a person (the \"commentator\"), other than the defendant or an employee or agent of the defendant, rather than a statement of fact; and\n                (b) the opinion related to a matter of public interest; and\n                (c) the opinion is based on proper material.\n        (4) A defence established under this section is defeated if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that –\n                (a) in the case of a defence under subsection (1) , the opinion was not honestly held by the defendant at the time the defamatory matter was published; or\n                (b) in the case of a defence under subsection (2) , the defendant did not believe that the opinion was honestly held by the employee or agent at the time the defamatory matter was published; or\n                (c) in the case of a defence under subsection (3) , the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the opinion was not honestly held by the commentator at the time the defamatory matter was published.\n        (5) For the purposes of this section, an opinion is based on proper material if –\n                (a) the material on which it is based is –\n                        (i) set out in specific or general terms in the published matter; or\n                        (ii) notorious; or\n                        (iii) accessible from a reference, link or other access point included in the matter (for example, a hyperlink on a webpage); or\n                        (iv) otherwise apparent from the context in which the matter is published; and\n                (b) the material –\n                        (i) is substantially true; or\n                        (ii) was published on an occasion of absolute or qualified privilege (whether under this Act or at general law); or\n                        (iii) was published on an occasion that attracted the protection of a defence under this section or section 28 or 29 .\n        (6) An opinion does not cease to be based on proper material only because some of the material on which it is based is not proper material if the opinion might reasonably be based on such of the material as is proper material.\n\n32. Defence of innocent dissemination\n        (1) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that –\n                (a) the defendant published the matter merely in the capacity, or as an employee or agent, of a subordinate distributor; and\n                (b) the defendant neither knew, nor ought reasonably to have known, that the matter was defamatory; and\n                (c) the defendant's lack of knowledge was not due to any negligence on the part of the defendant.\n        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) , a person is a subordinate distributor of defamatory matter if the person –\n                (a) was not the first or primary distributor of the matter; and\n                (b) was not the author or originator of the matter; and\n                (c) did not have any capacity to exercise editorial control over the content of the matter (or over the publication of the matter) before it was first published.\n        (3) Without limiting subsection (2)(a) , a person is not the first or primary distributor of matter merely because the person was involved in the publication of the matter in the capacity of –\n                (a) a bookseller, newsagent or news vendor; or\n                (b) a librarian; or\n                (c) a wholesaler or retailer of the matter; or\n                (d) a provider of postal or similar services by means of which the matter is published; or\n                (e) a broadcaster of a live programme (whether on television, radio or otherwise) containing the matter in circumstances in which the broadcaster has no effective control over the person who makes the statements that comprise the matter; or\n                (f) a provider of services consisting of –\n                        (i) the processing, copying, distributing or selling of any electronic medium in or on which the matter is recorded; or\n                        (ii) the operation or the provision of any equipment, system or service, by means of which the matter is retrieved, copied, distributed or made available in electronic form; or\n                (g) an operator of, or a provider of access to, a communications system by means of which the matter is transmitted, or made available, by another person over whom the operator or provider has not effective control; or\n                (h) a person who, on the instructions or at the direction of another person, prints or produces, reprints or reproduces or distributes the matter for or on behalf of that other person.\n\n33.\n. . . . . . . .\n\nDivision 3 - Remedies\n\n34. Damages to bear rational relationship to harm\n    In determining the amount of damages to be awarded in any defamation proceedings, the court is to ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the harm sustained by the plaintiff and the amount of damages awarded.\n\n35. Damages for non-economic loss limited\n        (1) The maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss that may be awarded in defamation proceedings is $250 000 or any other amount adjusted in accordance with this section from time to time (the \"maximum damages amount\") that is applicable at the time damages are awarded.\n        (2) The maximum damages amount is to be awarded only in a most serious case.\n        (2A) Subsection (1) does not limit the courts power to award aggravated damages if an award of aggravated damages is warranted in the circumstances.\n        (2B) An award of aggravated damages is to be made separately to any award of damages for non-economic loss to which subsection (1) applies.\n        (3) The Minister is, on or before 1 July 2006 and on or before 1 July in each succeeding year, to declare, by order published in the Gazette, the amount that is to apply, as from the date specified in the order, for the purposes of subsection (1) .\n        (4) The amount declared is to be the amount applicable under subsection (1) (or that amount as last adjusted under this section) adjusted by the percentage change in the amount estimated by the Australian Statistician of the average weekly total earnings of full-time adults in Australia over the 4 quarters preceding the date of the declaration for which those estimates are, at that date, available.\n        (5) An amount declared for the time being under this section applies to the exclusion of the amount of $250 000 or an amount previously adjusted under this section.\n        (6) If the Australian Statistician fails or ceases to estimate the amount referred to in subsection (4) , the amount declared is to be determined in accordance with the regulations.\n        (7) In adjusting an amount to be declared for the purposes of subsection (1) , the amount determined in accordance with subsection (4) is to be rounded to the nearest $500.\n        (8) A declaration made or published in the Gazette after 1 July in a year, and specifying a date that is before the date it is made or published as the date from which the amount declared by the order is to apply, has effect as from that specified date.\n\n36. State of mind of defendant generally not relevant to awarding damages\n    In awarding damages for defamation, the court is to disregard the malice or other state of mind of the defendant at the time of the publication of the defamatory matter to which the proceedings relate or at any other time except to the extent that the malice or other state of mind affects the harm sustained by the plaintiff.\n\n37. Exemplary or punitive damages cannot be awarded\n    A plaintiff cannot be awarded exemplary or punitive damages for defamation.\n\n38. Factors in mitigation of damages\n        (1) Evidence is admissible on behalf of the defendant, in mitigation of damages for the publication of defamatory matter, that –\n                (a) the defendant has made an apology to the plaintiff about the publication of the defamatory matter; or\n                (b) the defendant has published a correction of the defamatory matter; or\n                (c) the plaintiff has already recovered damages for defamation in relation to any other publication of matter having the same meaning or effect as the defamatory matter; or\n                (d) the plaintiff has brought proceedings for damages for defamation in relation to any other publication of matter having the same meaning or effect as the defamatory matter; or\n                (e) the plaintiff has received or agreed to receive compensation for defamation in relation to any other publication of matter having the same meaning or effect as the defamatory matter.\n        (2) Nothing in subsection (1) operates to limit the matters that can be taken into account by a court in mitigation of damages.\n\n39. Damages for multiple causes of action may be assessed as single sum\n    If the court in defamation proceedings finds for the plaintiff as to more than one cause of action, the judicial officer may assess damages in a single sum.\n\nDivision 4 - Costs\n\n40. Costs in defamation proceedings\n        (1) In awarding costs in defamation proceedings, the court may have regard to –\n                (a) the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases (including any misuse of a party's superior financial position to hinder the early resolution of the proceedings); and\n                (b) any other matters that the court considers relevant.\n        (2) Without limiting subsection (1) , a court must (unless the interests of justice require otherwise) –\n                (a) if defamation proceedings are successfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the plaintiff, order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the defendant unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff; or\n                (b) if defamation proceedings are unsuccessfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the defendant, order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to accept a settlement offer made by the defendant.\n        (3) In this section –\n            settlement offer means any offer to settle the proceedings made before the proceedings are determined, and includes an offer to make amends (whether made before or after the proceedings are commenced), that was a reasonable offer at the time it was made.\n\nPART 5 - Miscellaneous\n\n41. Proof of publication\n        (1) If a document appears to be printed or otherwise produced by means adapted for the production of numerous copies and there is in the document a statement to the effect that the document is printed, produced, published or distributed by or for a particular person, the statement is evidence in defamation proceedings that the document was so printed, produced, published or distributed.\n        (2) Evidence that a number or part of a document appearing to be a periodical is printed, produced, published or distributed by or for a particular person is evidence in defamation proceedings that a document appearing to be another number or part of the periodical was so printed, produced, published or distributed.\n        (3) In this section –\n            periodical includes any newspaper, review, magazine or other printed document of which numbers or parts are published periodically.\n\n42. Proof of convictions for offences\n        (1) If the question whether or not a person committed an offence is in question in defamation proceedings –\n                (a) proof that the person was convicted of the offence by an Australian court is conclusive evidence that the person committed the offence; and\n                (b) proof that the person was convicted of the offence by a court of any country (other than an Australian court) or a court martial of any country is evidence that the person committed the offence.\n        (2) For the purposes of this section, the contents of a document that is evidence of conviction of an offence, and the contents of an information, complaint, indictment, charge sheet or similar document on which a person is convicted of an offence, are admissible in evidence to identify the facts on which the conviction is based.\n        (3) Subsection (2) does not affect the admissibility of other evidence to identify the facts on which the conviction is based.\n        (4) In this section –\n            conviction for an offence includes a finding of guilt but does not include –\n                    (a) a conviction that has been set aside or quashed; or\n                    (b) a conviction for an offence for which a person has received a pardon.\n\n43. Incriminating answers, documents or things\n        (1) A person who is required to answer a question, or to discover or produce a document or thing, in defamation proceedings is not excused from answering the question, or discovering or producing the document or thing, on the ground that the answer to the question or the discovery or production of the document or thing might tend to incriminate the person of an offence of criminal defamation.\n        (2) However, any answer given to a question, or document or thing discovered or produced, by a natural person in compliance with the requirement is not admissible in evidence against the person in proceedings for criminal defamation.\n\n44. Giving of notices and other documents\n        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a notice or other document may be given to a person (or a notice or other document may be served on a person) –\n                (a) in the case of a natural person, by –\n                        (i) delivering it to the person personally; or\n                        (ii) sending it by post to the address specified by the person for the giving or service of documents or, if no such address is specified, the residential or business address of the person last known to the person giving or serving the document; or\n                        (iii) sending it by facsimile transmission to the facsimile number of the person; or\n                        (iv) sending it by email to an email address specified by the person for the giving or service of documents; or\n                (b) in the case of a body corporate, by –\n                        (i) leaving it with a person apparently of or above the age of 16 years at, or by sending it by post to, the head office, a registered office or a principal office of the body corporate or to an address specified by the body corporate for the giving or service of documents; or\n                        (ii) sending it by facsimile transmission to the facsimile number of the body corporate; or\n                        (iii) sending it by email to an email address specified by the body corporate for the giving or service of documents.\n        (2) Nothing in this section affects the operation of any provision of a law or of the rules of a court authorising a document to be served on a person in any other manner.\n\n45.
