Emergency works access to adjoining land\n        (1) This section applies if a railway entity needs access to adjoining land to carry out emergency railway works.\n        (2) The railway entity, acting through its railway employees, may access the adjoining land, if necessary without warning or permission, to such extent and for such period as is reasonably necessary to carry out the emergency railway works.\n        (3) If the access is effected without warning, the railway entity is to alert the adjoining landholder of the access and the nature of the railway emergency and emergency railway works as soon as practicable.\n        (4) In effecting the access, the railway entity may –\n                (a) call on and use such assistance as the railway entity considers necessary in the circumstances; and\n                (b) adjust or shut off any machinery, energy supply, water supply or other thing on the adjoining land that, if not adjusted or shut off, is likely to worsen the railway emergency or create a fresh emergency; and\n                (c) if there is no alternative, make use of anything on the land, other than machinery, that may serve to prevent a worsening of the railway emergency or prevent a fresh emergency; and\n                (d) open any door, gate, fence or other barrier, if necessary by forcing a lock, latch or chain or by dismantling or removing the barrier.\n        (5) However, in effecting the access, the railway entity is to –\n                (a) cause as little damage and disruption as possible; and\n                (b) do whatever can be practicably done in the circumstances for the welfare of stock; and\n                (c) make reasonable enquiry as to whether the adjoining land is subject to any protective protocols and, if so, respect those protocols; and\n                (d) do whatever can be practicably done in the circumstances to accommodate reasonable concerns of the adjoining landholder.\n        (6) Once the access has been effected, section 25 applies.\n        (7) Where more than one railway entity accesses adjoining land under this section in respect of the same railway emergency –\n                (a) the rights and obligations of those railway entities under this section and section 25 are joint and several; and\n                (b) if a dispute arises between those railway entities as to their respective liability regarding any of those obligations, the dispute is to be determined by an arbitral tribunal, within the meaning of the Commercial Arbitration Act 2011 , in accordance with that Act.\n        (8) For a restricted Railway Infrastructure Manager, this section applies only in respect of its part of the rail network.\n\n22. Routine works access to adjoining land – with permission\n        (1) This section applies if an adjoining landholder gives a railway entity permission to access adjoining land to carry out routine railway works.\n        (2) The railway entity is to ensure that –\n                (a) the adjoining landholder is warned when the access is about to be effected; and\n                (b) the access is effected in accordance with the terms of the permission and with as little damage and disruption as possible; and\n                (c) if circumstances require, the adjoining land is fenced or otherwise secured so as to maintain the adjoining landholder's level of protection as regards trespass and, if applicable, loss of stock; and\n                (d) it respects all protective protocols of which it has notice; and\n                (e) it vacates the adjoining land forthwith and without argument if the permission is for any reason withdrawn.\n        (3) Once the access has been effected then, except in so far as the adjoining landholder and the railway entity may otherwise agree, section 25 applies.\n\n23. Routine works access to adjoining land – without permission\n        (1) This section applies if –\n                (a) a railway entity needs access to adjoining land to carry out routine railway works but the adjoining landholder –\n                        (i) cannot, despite the railway entity's best endeavours, be contacted; or\n                        (ii) is, for any reason, incapable of permitting the access; or\n                        (iii) has, despite the railway entity's reasonable entreaties, unreasonably refused to permit the access; or\n                        (iv) has imposed such stringent conditions on the access that the routine railway works would be unreasonably expensive, time-consuming or difficult to carry out or could not be carried out safely, properly or at all; or\n                (b) a railway entity is unable to complete routine railway works because an adjoining landholder has unreasonably withdrawn permission for the railway entity to access adjoining land.\n        (2) The railway entity –\n                (a) may apply to a justice for a warrant to access the land for the purposes of carrying out or, as the case may be, completing the routine railway works; but\n                (b) must give the adjoining landholder at least 5 clear days' notice of its intention to make the application or, if subsection (1)(a)(i) applies, make a reasonable attempt to give such notice.\n        (3) The justice may issue the warrant if satisfied on reasonable grounds that –\n                (a) the routine railway works are necessary for the safety or operability of the rail network; and\n                (b) there is no feasible, safe or cost-effective way of carrying out or, as the case may be, completing the routine railway works except by accessing the adjoining land; and\n                (c) the railway entity will exercise the right of access responsibly; and\n                (d) the railway entity has complied with subsection (2)(b) .\n        (4) The warrant may –\n                (a) authorise the access by reference to specified times or specified periods; and\n                (b) be issued on such conditions as the justice considers appropriate.\n        (5) Without limiting this, the conditions may –\n                (a) require the railway entity to meet specified notification or other requirements before exercising the right of access; and\n                (b) provide for the adjoining land to be fenced or otherwise secured so as to maintain the adjoining landholder's level of protection as regards trespass and, if applicable, loss of stock.\n        (6) The warrant is to specify whether the right of access being conferred is a right to cross over the adjoining land or a right to enter and remain on the adjoining land.\n        (7) The warrant authorises the railway entity, acting through its railway employees, to access the adjoining land to carry out the routine railway works specified in the warrant, at the times or during the periods specified in the warrant and on the conditions specified in the warrant.\n        (8) In effecting the access and carrying out the routine railway works, the railway entity –\n                (a) may call on and use such assistance as it considers necessary or expedient in the circumstances; and\n                (b) must, whether or not they are mentioned in the warrant, respect all protective protocols of which it has notice.\n        (9) Once access has been effected pursuant to the warrant, section 25 applies.\n        (10) The railway employee in charge of executing the warrant for the railway entity must produce it for inspection if asked to do so by the adjoining landholder.\n        (11) The warrant is to specify the date on which, and the time at which, the warrant ceases to have effect.\n        (12) The date specified in the warrant pursuant to subsection (11) is to be a date falling no later than 3 months after the warrant is issued.\n        (13) For a restricted Railway Infrastructure Manager, this section applies only in respect of its part of the rail network.\n\n24. Clearing obstructions to lines of sight, &c.\n        (1) This section applies if a railway entity other than a Rolling Stock Operator reasonably considers that –\n                (a) any fence, sign or vegetation on adjoining land is obstructing a line of sight in respect of the rail network; and\n                (b) the obstruction poses a genuine risk to the safety of the rail network or to road users or other persons.\n        (2) The railway entity may give the adjoining landholder a notice (in this section referred to as a \"clearance notice\") requiring the adjoining landholder to clear the obstruction by, as circumstances require –\n                (a) modifying the fence or sign or trimming the vegetation; or\n                (b) if necessary, relocating or removing the fence, sign or vegetation.\n        (3) The clearance notice is to allow the adjoining landholder a reasonable period, of at least 21 days, in which to clear the obstruction.\n        (4) The railway entity may, by the clearance notice or otherwise, offer the adjoining landholder help in clearing the obstruction.\n        (5) If the adjoining landholder fails for any reason to comply with the clearance notice, the railway entity may apply to a justice for a warrant to access the land to clear the obstruction.\n        (6) The justice may issue the warrant if satisfied on reasonable grounds that –\n                (a) the fence, sign or vegetation in question is obstructing a line of sight in respect of the rail network; and\n                (b) the obstruction poses a genuine risk to the safety of the rail network or to road users or other persons; and\n                (c) a clearance notice given in respect of the obstruction has not been complied with; and\n                (d) the railway entity has received no indication that the adjoining landholder is likely to clear the obstruction within, in terms of the level of risk, a reasonable time; and\n                (e) there are no countervailing heritage, environmental or other considerations to which the relevant safety considerations ought to be subordinated.\n        (7) The warrant may be issued on such conditions as the justice considers appropriate.\n        (8) Without limiting this, the conditions may –\n                (a) require the railway entity to meet specified notification or other requirements before exercising the right of access; and\n                (b) provide for the adjoining land to be fenced or otherwise secured so as to maintain the adjoining landholder's level of protection as regards trespass and, if applicable, loss of stock.\n        (9) The warrant authorises the railway entity, acting through its railway employees, to access the adjoining land and, causing as little damage and disruption as possible, clear the obstruction specified in the warrant in the way specified in the warrant.\n        (10) In effecting the access and clearing the obstruction, the railway entity –\n                (a) may call on and use such assistance as it considers necessary or expedient in the circumstances; and\n                (b) must, whether or not they are mentioned in the warrant, respect all protective protocols of which it has notice.\n        (11) Once access has been effected pursuant to the warrant, section 25 applies.\n        (12) The railway employee in charge of executing the warrant for the railway entity must produce it for inspection if asked to do so by the adjoining landholder.\n        (13) The warrant is to specify the date on which, and the time at which, the warrant ceases to have effect.\n        (14) The date specified in the warrant pursuant to subsection (13) is to be a date falling no later than 3 months after the warrant is issued.\n        (15) Any costs reasonably incurred by the railway entity in clearing the obstruction pursuant to the warrant are recoverable as a debt due to the railway entity from the adjoining landholder.\n        (16) For a restricted Railway Infrastructure Manager, this section applies only in respect of its part of the rail network.\n        (17) In this section –\n            fence incudes screen and free-standing wall;\n            line of sight, in respect of the rail network, means –\n                    (a) a view that, for safety and operational purposes, a train driver needs to have of railway tracks ahead or of vehicles approaching or traversing a railway crossing; and\n                    (b) a view that, for personal safety, road users need to have of trains approaching or traversing a railway crossing;\n            sign includes the pole, hoarding or other structure on which the sign is displayed.\n\n25. Damage to be made good, &c.\n        (1) This section applies if a railway entity has accessed adjoining land under section 21 , 22 , 23 or 24 to carry out railway works or other works.\n        (2) As soon as practicable after completing the works, the railway entity must –\n                (a) make good any unsanctioned damage caused to or in respect of the adjoining land as a result of effecting the access or carrying out the works; or\n                (b) pay the adjoining landholder fair compensation for that unsanctioned damage.\n        (3) Any dispute regarding the nature or extent of the railway entity's obligation under subsection (2) is to be determined by an arbitral tribunal, within the meaning of the Commercial Arbitration Act 2011 , in accordance with that Act.\n        (4) Without prejudice to the Commercial Arbitration Act 2011 , matters that may be considered in the arbitration include, but are not limited to, the following:\n                (a) whether some act or omission of the adjoining landholder triggered or contributed to the need to carry out the works;\n                (b) whether the unsanctioned damage was needlessly made worse by some act or omission of the adjoining landholder;\n                (c) whether the adjoining landholder took, or failed to take, measures that were reasonably available to avoid or minimise the unsanctioned damage;\n                (d) whether the railway entity effected the access and carried out the works as responsibly, efficiently and expeditiously as possible in the circumstances;\n                (e) whether some act or omission of the railway entity triggered or contributed to the need to carry out the works;\n                (f) whether the unsanctioned damage was needlessly made worse by some act or omission of the railway entity;\n                (g) whether the railway entity took, or failed to take, measures that were reasonably available to avoid or minimise the unsanctioned damage.\n        (5) In this section –\n            unsanctioned damage means damage other than –\n                    (a) for section 21 , damage directly resulting from an action taken in good faith to ensure the immediate safety of persons, or of stock or other animals, on the adjoining land; and\n                    (b) for section 24 , damage resulting from the actual modification or removal of the relevant obstruction.\n\n26.
