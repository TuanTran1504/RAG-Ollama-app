Issuing of ballot papers\n            When issuing ballot papers, an election official is to, as far as is practicable, issue an elector with a ballot paper in a different form from the previous ballot paper he or she issued.\n\n    SCHEDULE 4 - Method of counting votes recorded at assembly election\n\n    Sections 145 and 232\n\n        1. Interpretation\n                (1) In this Schedule, unless the contrary intention appears –\n                    quota means the number of votes sufficient to elect a candidate at an election;\n                    second preference recorded for a candidate means the recording of the number \"2\" in the box next to the name of a candidate on a ballot paper;\n                    surplus means the number of votes which a candidate has obtained, at any stage of the counting of votes, in excess of the quota;\n                    transfer value means that portion of a vote which is transferred to the candidate next in the order of the elector's preference because it is unused by –\n                            (a) an elected candidate who has obtained a surplus; or\n                            (b) a candidate excluded on account of his or her having the least number of votes.\n                (2) For the purpose of the definition of \"transfer value\" in subclause (1) , the transfer value of a vote is either one or a fraction of one.\n        2. First preference votes to be counted\n            The number of first preferences recorded for each candidate, on ballot papers which are not informal ballot papers, is to be counted.\n        3. Quota\n            The aggregate number of first preferences so recorded is to be divided by one more than the number of candidates required to be elected, and the quotient increased by one, disregarding any remainder, is to be the quota and (except as provided in clause 11 ) no candidate is to be elected until he or she obtains a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota.\n        4. Candidate with quota to be elected\n            A candidate who has, after the first preferences have been counted, a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota is to be declared elected.\n        5. Candidate with exact quota\n            If the number of first preferences obtained by a candidate is equal to the quota, all the ballot papers on which a first preference is recorded for that candidate are to be set aside as finally dealt with.\n        6. Surplus first preference votes to be distributed\n            If the number of first preferences obtained by a candidate is in excess of the quota, the surplus is to be transferred to the other candidates not yet declared elected, next in the order of the electors' respective preferences, in the following manner:\n                    (a) all the ballot papers on which a first preference is recorded for the elected candidate are to be re-examined, and the number of second preferences, or, in the case provided for in clause 13 , third or next consecutive preferences, recorded for each unelected candidate are to be counted;\n                    (b) the surplus of the elected candidate is to be divided by the total number of votes obtained by the candidate on the counting of the first preferences, and the resulting fraction is to be the transfer value;\n                    (c) the number of second or other preferences, ascertained in paragraph (a) to be recorded for each unelected candidate, is to be multiplied by the transfer value;\n                    (d) the resulting number, disregarding any fractional remainder, is to be transferred to each unelected candidate, and added to the number of votes obtained by him or her on the counting of the first preferences.\n        7. Order of distributing surpluses\n                (1) If, on the counting of the first preferences or on a transfer, more than one candidate has a surplus, the largest surplus is to be dealt with first and, if at that stage more than one candidate has a surplus, the then largest surplus is to be dealt with, and so on, but if one candidate has obtained a surplus at a count or transfer previous to that at which another candidate obtains a surplus, the surplus of the former is to be dealt with first.\n                (2) If 2 or more surpluses are equal, the surplus of the candidate who was recorded as having the highest number of votes at the last count or transfer at which the candidates had an unequal number of votes is to be dealt with first, and, if the candidates have had an equal number of votes at all preceding counts or transfers, the candidate whose surplus is to be dealt with first is to be determined by an approved method.\n        8. Method of dealing with surplus votes obtained at transfer of surplus\n                (1) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased to a number which is equal to, or exceeds, the quota by a transfer under clause 6 , the candidate is to be declared elected.\n                (2) In a case to which subclause (1) applies, notwithstanding the fact that the candidate has reached the quota, the transfer is to be completed, and all the votes to which the candidate is entitled from the transfer are to be transferred to the candidate, but no votes of any other candidate are to be transferred to him or her.\n                (3) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased by a transfer under clause 6 to a number which is equal to the quota, all the ballot papers on which such votes are recorded are to be set aside as finally dealt with.\n                (4) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased by a transfer under clause 6 to a number which exceeds the quota, his or her surplus is to be transferred to the candidates next in the order of the electors' respective preferences, in the following manner:\n                        (a) the ballot papers on which are recorded the votes obtained by the elected candidate in the last transfer are to be re-examined, and the number of third, or, in the case provided for in clause 13 , next consecutive preferences recorded for each unelected candidate are to be counted;\n                        (b) the surplus of the elected candidate is to be divided by the total number of ballot papers mentioned in paragraph (a) , and the resulting fraction is to be the transfer value;\n                        (c) the number of third or other preferences, ascertained in accordance with paragraph (a) as having been recorded for each unelected candidate, is to be multiplied by the last-mentioned transfer value;\n                        (d) the resulting number, disregarding any fractional remainder, is to be credited to each unelected candidate and added to the number of votes previously obtained by him or her.\n        9. Method of transferring votes of excluded candidates\n                (1) If, after the first preferences have been counted and all surpluses, if any, have been transferred as provided by this Schedule, no candidate, or less than the number of candidates required to be elected, has or have obtained the quota, the candidate who, at that count or transfer, has the least number of votes is to be excluded, and all the votes obtained by him or her are to be transferred to the candidates next in the order of the electors' respective preferences, in the same manner as provided by clause 6 .\n                (2) The votes received by the excluded candidate are to be sorted into groups according to their transfer values when received by that candidate.\n                (3) The groups are to be transferred, at the transfer value at which they were received, in the following order:\n                        (a) firstly, the group with the highest transfer value;\n                        (b) secondly, the remaining groups in descending order of transfer value.\n                (4) Each of the transfers which takes place under subclause (3) is to be taken for all purposes to be a separate transfer.\n        10. Method of dealing with surplus votes obtained at transfer from excluded candidate\n                (1) If the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased by a transfer under subclause (4) , clause 9 or clause 11 to a number which is equal to, or exceeds, the quota, the candidate is to be declared elected.\n                (2) In a case to which subclause (1) applies, notwithstanding the fact that the candidate has reached the quota, the transfer is to be completed, and all the votes to which the candidate is entitled from the transfer are to be transferred to him or her, but no other votes are to be transferred to him or her.\n                (3) If, by a transfer under subclause (4) , clause 9 or clause 11 , the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased to a number of votes which is equal to, but does not exceed, the quota, all the ballot papers on which those votes are recorded are to be set aside as finally dealt with.\n                (4) If, by a transfer under this subclause, clause 9 or clause 11 , the number of votes obtained by a candidate is increased to a number which exceeds the quota, his or her surplus is to be transferred to the candidates next in the order of the electors' respective preferences in the same manner as provided by clause 8(4) , but, in the case of a transfer of the votes of an excluded candidate under clause 9 or 11 , that surplus is not to be dealt with until all the votes of that excluded candidate have been transferred.\n                (5) If a surplus exists, it is to be dealt with before any other candidate is excluded.\n        11. Exclusion of candidates to continue\n            The process of excluding the candidate who has polled the next lowest number of votes at the election and transferring to other candidates his or her votes, in accordance with clause 9 , is to be repeated until all the candidates, except the number required to be elected, have been excluded, and the unexcluded candidates who have not already been so declared are then to be declared elected.\n        12. Candidates with equal number of votes\n            If on any count 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them is to be excluded, then whichever of those candidates was recorded as having the least number of votes at the last count or transfer at which they had an unequal number of votes is to be excluded, and, if those candidates have had an equal number of votes at all preceding counts or transfers, the candidate to be excluded is to be determined by an approved method.\n        13. Next available preferences\n            In determining which candidate is next in the order of an elector's preference, any candidates who have been declared elected or who have been excluded are not to be considered, and the order of the elector's preference is to be determined as if the names of those candidates had not been on the ballot paper.\n        14. Ballot paper taken to be exhausted\n            If on a transfer it is found that on a ballot paper there is no candidate opposite whose name a number is placed, other than a candidate who has been declared elected or excluded, the ballot paper is to be set aside as exhausted.\n\n    SCHEDULE 5 - Method of counting votes recorded at council election\n\n    Section 145\n\n        1. Interpretation\n            In this Schedule, a reference to an absolute majority of votes, in relation to a candidate at an election, is a reference to a number of votes greater than one-half of the total number of ballot papers on which electors have recorded their votes for the candidate at the election, other than exhausted and informal ballot papers.\n        2. First preference votes to be counted\n            The number of first preferences recorded for each candidate is to be counted, and all informal ballot papers are to be rejected.\n        3. Candidate with absolute majority of votes to be elected\n            If a candidate obtains an absolute majority of votes, he or she is to be elected.\n        4. Candidate with fewest votes to be excluded\n            If no candidate has an absolute majority of votes, the candidate who has the least number of votes is to be excluded, and each ballot paper counted to him or her is, unless exhausted, to be counted to the unexcluded candidate next in the order of the elector's preference.\n        5. Exclusion of candidates to continue\n            If no candidate then has an absolute majority of votes, the process, as specified in clause 4 , of excluding the candidate who has the fewest votes and counting each of the ballot papers counted to him or her, unless exhausted, to the unexcluded candidate next in the order of the elector's preference is to be repeated until one candidate has an absolute majority of votes.\n        6. Formal ballot papers to be counted until exhausted\n            Every ballot paper not rejected as informal is to be counted in every count until it becomes exhausted, and then is to be rejected in all further counts.\n        7. Ballot paper taken to be exhausted\n            When a candidate is excluded, any ballot paper counted to him or her is to be taken to be exhausted if there is not indicated on it a consecutive preference for one unexcluded candidate.\n        8. Candidates with equal number of votes\n                (1) If on any count 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them is to be excluded, then whichever of those candidates was recorded as having the least number of votes at the last count at which they had an unequal number of votes is to be excluded, and if those candidates have had an equal number of votes at all preceding counts, the candidate to be excluded is to be determined by an approved method.\n                (2) If following the final count a candidate is excluded in accordance with subclause (1) and only one unexcluded candidate remains, that unexcluded candidate is to be elected.\n\n    SCHEDULE 6 - Method of filling vacancy arising in House of Assembly\n\n    Section 231\n\n        1. Interpretation\n            In this Schedule –\n                    (a) a reference to a consenting candidate, in relation to a vacant seat in the Assembly, is a reference to a person who nominates himself or herself for the vacant seat as provided in section 227 ; and\n                    (b) a reference to the relevant election, in relation to a vacant seat, is a reference to the election last held, whether under this Act or the Electoral Act 1985 , to fill all of the seats for the Assembly division which the vacating member formerly represented in the Assembly; and\n                    (c) a reference to the vacating member is a reference to the member whose seat in the Assembly has become vacant; and\n                    (d) a reference to the vacant seat is a reference to the seat of the vacating member.\n        2. Case where there is only one consenting candidate\n            If there is only one consenting candidate, the Commissioner is to immediately –\n                    (a) declare the candidate to be duly elected as a member of the Assembly to fill the vacant seat; and\n                    (b) by writing under his or her hand notify the Governor of the election of the candidate.\n        3. Case where there are 2 or more consenting candidates\n            If there are 2 or more consenting candidates, the Commissioner is to, within 7 days after the date fixed for the receipt of nominations, proceed to ascertain in the manner provided by clause 4 , by an examination of all the completed ballot papers counted at the relevant election for the member whose seat has become vacant and the ballot papers directed to be counted for the vacating member as so provided, which of the consenting candidates is to be elected to fill the vacant seat.\n        4. Provisions to apply to determine which of 2 or more consenting candidates is to be elected\n                (1) In this clause, a reference to the completed ballot papers counted for the vacating member is –\n                        (a) if, after the first preferences were counted at the relevant election, the number of first preferences recorded for that member was equal to or exceeded the quota required for election to the Assembly, a reference to all the ballot papers on which those first preferences were recorded; and\n                        (b) in any other case, a reference to all the completed ballot papers counted for that member at the time of his or her election, including ballot papers relating to votes that were transferred to him or her.\n                (2) If –\n                        (a) the member whose seat has become vacant was, by virtue of clause 11 of Schedule 4 , declared elected at the relevant election after the candidate who was lowest on the poll at that election had been excluded from the counting; and\n                        (b) the votes obtained by the excluded candidate were not required to be transferred to the candidates next in the order of the electors' respective preferences –\n                so many of those votes as would have been transferred to that member if the votes of the excluded candidate had been transferred to the candidates next in the order of the electors' respective preferences, are, for the purposes of this clause, to be taken to have been so transferred to, and to be obtained by, that member and the completed ballot papers representing those votes are to be counted for that member.\n                (3) The ballot papers counted, or by subclause (2) , directed to be counted, for the vacating member are to be examined, and all the votes obtained, or taken to have been obtained, by him or her are to be transferred to and counted for the consenting candidates first or next in the order of the electors' respective preferences.\n                (4) The votes obtained as first preferences by the vacating member at the relevant election are to be transferred to the next preferred candidate at that election, with the transfer value of each of those votes determined in accordance with subclause (5) , and the other votes (if any) of the vacating member are then to be dealt with in the order of the transfers in which they were obtained and at the transfer value determined in accordance with subclause (6) .\n                (5) If the votes obtained as first preferences by the vacating member –\n                        (a) were sufficient to elect the member, the transfer value of those votes is the fraction determined by dividing the number of votes sufficient to elect the member by the total number of votes obtained by the member; or\n                        (b) were insufficient to elect the member, the transfer value of those votes is one.\n                (6) If the votes obtained by the vacating member at an individual count, other than the votes obtained as first preferences –\n                        (a) did not provide a sufficient number of votes to elect that member, the transfer value of the votes obtained on such a count is that at which they were obtained by the member; or\n                        (b) provided a sufficient number of votes to elect the member, the transfer value of the votes received at that count is that which would have provided the number of votes which the member required to be elected immediately prior to that count.\n                (7) Each of the transfers which takes place under subclause (4) is to be taken for the purposes of this Schedule to be a separate transfer.\n                (8) For the purposes of determining which consenting candidate is first or next in the order of the electors' preferences –\n                        (a) the name of, and first choices recorded at the relevant election for, an excluded candidate who is a consenting candidate at the election to fill the vacant seat are, for the purposes of that last-mentioned election, not to be omitted from any completed ballot papers transferred to the vacating member, but are to be counted for that consenting candidate; and\n                        (b) any candidates who were declared elected at the relevant election or who are not consenting candidates are to be disregarded and the order of the electors' respective preferences is to be determined as if the names of those candidates had not been included on the ballot papers.\n                (9) If, in relation to a completed ballot paper, it is found that there is no candidate opposite whose name a number has been placed other than a candidate –\n                        (a) who has already been declared elected; or\n                        (b) who is not a consenting candidate; or\n                        (c) whose name must, by virtue of section 103(2) , be omitted from the ballot paper when determining the order of the electors' respective preferences –\n                the ballot paper is to be set aside as exhausted.\n                (10) After the number of votes in favour of each consenting candidate has been ascertained in accordance with the preceding provisions of this clause, the method of counting votes set out in Schedule 5 where one member only has to be returned for a division is, with any necessary modifications, to be applied and followed, and the Commissioner is to declare the consenting candidate who obtains an absolute majority of the votes within the meaning of that Schedule to be duly elected to fill the vacant seat.\n        5. Case where vacating member elected under this Schedule\n            If the seat of a member of the Assembly becomes vacant and the vacating member was himself or herself elected under the provisions of this Schedule or of Schedule 5 to the Electoral Act 1985 (as in force immediately before the commencement of this Act) –\n                    (a) the Commissioner, for the purpose of filling the vacancy, is to examine the ballot papers that, at the relevant election, were counted for the member in whose place the vacating member was elected (including ballot papers representing votes transferred to the last-mentioned member); and\n                    (b) the foregoing provisions of this Schedule are accordingly to be construed subject to paragraph (a) .\n\n    SCHEDULE 7 - Savings and Transitional\n\n    Section 244\n\n        1.
