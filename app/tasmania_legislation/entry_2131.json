Preventative detention orders\n            (1) The Supreme Court or the senior police officer may, on an application under section 5 , make a preventative detention order in relation to a person if –\n                    (a) satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that –\n                            (i) the person –\n                                    (A) will engage in a terrorist act; or\n                                    (B) possesses or has under his or her control (whether solely or jointly with any other person) a thing that is connected with the preparation for, or the engagement of a person in, a terrorist act; or\n                                    (C) has done an act in preparation for, or in planning, a terrorist act; and\n                            (ii) making the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act occurring; and\n                            (iii) detaining the person for the period for which he or she is to be detained under the order is reasonably necessary for the purpose referred to in subparagraph (ii) ; or\n                    (b) satisfied on reasonable grounds that –\n                            (i) a terrorist act has occurred within the last 28 days; and\n                            (ii) it is reasonably necessary to detain the person to preserve evidence of, or relating to, the terrorist act; and\n                            (iii) detaining the person for the period for which he or she is to be detained under the order is reasonably necessary for the purpose referred to in subparagraph (ii) .\n            (2) A terrorist act referred to in subsection (1)(a) must be one –\n                    (a) that is imminent; and\n                    (b) that is expected to occur, in any event, at some time in the next 14 days.\n            (3) The Supreme Court or the senior police officer may refuse to make a preventative detention order unless the authorised police officer applying for it gives the Court or the officer (as the case requires) any further information that it, he or she requests concerning the grounds on which the order is sought.\n            (4) If the application to the Supreme Court is made without notice of it being given to the person in relation to whom a preventative detention order is being sought, the Supreme Court may, if in its opinion it is desirable to do so, make an interim preventative detention order pending the hearing and final determination of the application.\n            Note: The maximum period during which a person may be detained under an interim order is 48 hours or until the final determination of the application, whichever is the later: see section 9(3) .\n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n            \n                (5) If the Supreme Court makes an interim preventative detention order, it must –\n                        (a) specify a day on which, and time at which, the hearing of the application is to be resumed; and\n                        (b) direct the applicant to cause notice of the resumed hearing to be given to –\n                                (i) the person in relation to whom the interim order is made; and\n                                (ii) if the applicant is aware of the identity of a lawyer who acts for that person in relation to any matter, that lawyer.\n                (6) On a resumed hearing referred to in subsection (5) , the person in relation to whom the interim order is made is entitled to appear and give evidence, call witnesses, examine and cross-examine witnesses, adduce material and make submissions. However, his or her absence does not prevent the Supreme Court from finally determining the application.\n                (7) An interim preventative detention order that, but for this subsection, would cease to have effect before the application is finally determined, continues to have effect, subject to section 9(2) , until the application is finally determined.\n                (8) On finally determining an application following the making of an interim preventative detention order, the Supreme Court may by order –\n                        (a) confirm the order without variation or vary the period specified in the order as the period during which the person in relation to whom it is made may be detained under it; or\n                        Note: The period of detention in the confirmed order may be extended, or further extended, under section 11 .\n                                                                                                                                     \n                        \n                            (b) revoke the order if not satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1) .\n                    (9) If the person in relation to whom the interim preventative detention order is made is being detained in a prison, the applicant for that order must cause a copy of any order made under subsection (8) to be given to the Director of Corrective Services as soon as practicable after it is made.\n                    (10) On the hearing by the Supreme Court of an application under section 5 (including a resumed hearing referred to in subsection (5) of this section) –\n                            (a) the person in relation to whom a preventative detention order is being sought (including a person in relation to whom an interim preventative detention order or a preventative detention order made by a senior police officer is in force) is entitled to appear and give evidence, call witnesses, examine and cross-examine witnesses, adduce material and make submissions; but\n                            (b) the absence of that person does not prevent the Supreme Court from determining, or finally determining, the application.\n                    (11) If, on an application by an authorised police officer for the making of a preventative detention order in relation to a person who is being detained under a preventative detention order made or purportedly made by a senior police officer (the \"police order\"), the Supreme Court is satisfied that the making or purported making of the police order was so unreasonable that no senior police officer acting reasonably could have made that order, the Supreme Court may –\n                            (a) declare the police order to be void from its beginning; and\n                            (b) determine that the State should compensate the person, as assessed by the Supreme Court, in respect of any loss sustained or damage incurred by the person as a direct and reasonable consequence of his or her detention under the police order.\n                    (12) If the Supreme Court makes a determination under subsection (11)(b) , the State is liable to pay the compensation assessed by the Supreme Court and the Public Account is, to the necessary extent, appropriated for this purpose.\n\n            8. Nature of preventative detention order\n                    (1) A preventative detention order is an order that the person in relation to whom it is made (the subject) may be –\n                            (a) taken into custody (unless he or she is already being detained under a preventative detention order, or an order for his or her detention made under a corresponding preventative detention law, that is in force or was in force immediately before the making of the new order); and\n                            (b) detained during the period that –\n                                    (i) starts when the subject is first taken into custody or detained under the order (the \"start\"); and\n                                    (ii) ends a specified period of time after the start.\n                    (2) The order must be in writing.\n                    (3) Subject to section 9 , the period of time specified in the order under subsection (1)(b)(ii) must not exceed 14 days.\n                    (4) A preventative detention order must –\n                            (a) set out –\n                                    (i) the subject's true name; or\n                                    (ii) if, after reasonable inquiries have been made, the subject's true name is not known but an alias is known for the subject, the subject's alias; or\n                                    (iii) if, after reasonable inquiries have been made, the subject's true name is not known and no alias is known for the subject, a description sufficient to identify the subject; and\n                            (b) specify the period during which the subject may be detained under the order; and\n                            (c) specify the place or places where the subject may be, or must not be, detained under the order; and\n                            (d) specify the date on which, and the time at which, the order is made; and\n                            (e) specify whether the subject is prohibited from disclosing under section 32(2) the period for which he or she is being detained; and\n                            (f) specify whether the subject is allowed to have any further contact with a person under section 32(4) and, if so –\n                                    (i) the person or persons with whom he or she may have contact; and\n                                    (ii) the period for which he or she may have contact on any day and the number of days on which he or she may have such contact; and\n                                    (iii) whether the subject is prohibited from disclosing the period for which he or she is being detained to a person with whom he or she has contact; and\n                                    (iv) any other conditions applicable to the contact; and\n                            (g) set out, if applicable, particulars of the order for the subject's detention made under a corresponding preventative detention law on the ceasing to have effect of which the order is to start to have effect; and\n                            (h) specify, if applicable, the date and time after which the subject may not be taken into custody under the order.\n                    (5) If the subject is –\n                            (a) under 18 years of age; or\n                            (b) incapable of managing his or her affairs –\n                    the order may provide that the period each day for which the subject is entitled to have contact with another person under section 36(2) is the period of more than 2 hours that is specified in the order.\n\n            9. Duration of preventative detention orders\n                    (1) The maximum period that may be specified in a preventative detention order made by a senior police officer as the period during which a person may be detained under the order is 24 hours.\n                    (2) Subject to subsection (3) , the maximum period (including that period, as extended, or further extended, under section 11 ) that may be specified in a preventative detention order made by the Supreme Court as the period during which a person may be detained under the order is 14 days less any period during which the person is actually detained under –\n                            (a) a preventative detention order made by a senior police officer; or\n                            (b) an order for the person's detention made under a corresponding preventative detention law –\n                    on the same basis.\n                    (3) The maximum period that may be specified in an interim preventative detention order made by the Supreme Court as the period during which a person may be detained under the order is 48 hours.\n                    (4) Despite the period of detention specified in a preventative detention order made by a senior police officer, as soon as practicable after the person in relation to whom the order is made is first taken into custody or detained under the order, an application for a preventative detention order in relation to the person must be made to the Supreme Court.\n                    (5) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of subsection (2) orders are made on the same basis if –\n                            (a) in the case of orders made on the basis of preventing a terrorist act from occurring, they relate to the same terrorist act occurring within the same period; and\n                            (b) in the case of orders made on the basis of preserving evidence of, or relating to, a terrorist act, they relate to the same terrorist act.\n\n            10. When order starts and ceases to have effect\n                    (1) A preventative detention order in relation to a person starts to have effect –\n                            (a) if the preventative detention order so provides, on an order for the person's detention made under a corresponding preventative detention law ceasing to have effect; or\n                            (b) in any other case, when it is made.\n                            Note: When the order starts to have effect it authorises the person to be taken into custody, if necessary (see section 8(1)(a) ). The period for which the person may be detained under the order only starts to run when the person is first taken into custody or detained under the order ( section 8(1)(b) ).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n                            \n                        (2) A preventative detention order in relation to a person under which the person is required to be taken into custody ceases to have effect at the end of the period of 48 hours after the order is made if the person has not been taken into custody under the order within that period.\n                        (3) If a preventative detention order does not cease to have effect under subsection (2) , it ceases to have effect when whichever of the following first occurs:\n                                (a) the end of –\n                                        (i) the period specified in the order as the period during which the person may be detained under the order; or\n                                        (ii) if that period is extended or further extended under section 11 , that period as extended or further extended;\n                                (b) if the order was made by a senior police officer, a preventative detention order is made by the Supreme Court in relation to the same person;\n                                (c) the revocation of the order under section 7 , 16 or 17 .\n                                Note: The order does not cease to have effect merely because the person is released from detention under the order.\n                                                                                                                                                   \n                                \n\n                    11. Extension of preventative detention order\n                            (1) If –\n                                    (a) a preventative detention order is made by the Supreme Court in relation to a person on the final determination of an application under section 5 ; and\n                                    (b) the order is in force in relation to the person –\n                            an authorised police officer may apply to the Supreme Court for an extension, or a further extension, of the period for which the order is to be in force in relation to the person.\n                            (2) The application must –\n                                    (a) be made in writing; and\n                                    (ab) set out –\n                                            (i) the true name of the person in relation to whom the extension is sought; or\n                                            (ii) if, after reasonable inquiries have been made, the true name of the person in relation to whom the extension is sought is not known but an alias is known for the person, the person's alias; or\n                                            (iii) if, after reasonable inquiries have been made, the true name of the person in relation to whom the extension is sought is not known and no alias is known for the person, a description sufficient to identify the person; and\n                                    (b) set out the facts and other grounds on which the applicant considers that the extension, or further extension, is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which the order was made; and\n                                    (c) set out the outcomes and particulars of all previous applications for extensions, or further extensions, of the order.\n                            (3) The application must be sworn by the applicant.\n                            (4) The applicant must cause notice of the application to be given to the person in relation to whom the preventative detention order is in force.\n                            (5) The person in relation to whom the preventative detention order is in force is entitled to appear on the hearing and give evidence, call witnesses, examine and cross-examine witnesses, adduce material and make submissions.
