Pricing zones\n        (1) A price determination may specify that a price and service plan is to include, or is not to include, pricing zones.\n        (2) A price determination may only specify that a price and service plan is to include pricing zones if there are significant differences in the costs of providing the regulated service to different areas of land within the area to which the regulated service may be provided by the regulated entity.\n        (3) A price determination is not to require that a price and service plan is to include pricing zones if, in the opinion of the Regulator, the costs of implementing such zones would outweigh the benefits of doing so.\n        (4) Prices charged, in relation to the provision of a regulated service by a regulated entity in respect of properties within a pricing zone, are to reflect, so far as is commercially and technically practicable, the costs of providing the regulated service to the properties.\n\n6. Estimates of changes of prices over life of plan\n    A price determination is to require a price and service plan to include anticipated changes, over time, of any prices specified in the plan.\n\nDivision 2 - Charges policies\n\n7. Developer charges policy\n        (1) A price determination is to require a regulated entitys price and service plan to include a policy in respect of developer charges (a developer charges policy) that complies with these regulations.\n        (2) A regulated entitys developer charges policy is to specify the method by which the amount of a developer charge will be calculated by the entity.\n        (3) A regulated entity must ensure that the entitys developer charges policy includes information that enables a person to calculate the amount of the developer charge estimated to be payable in respect of a proposed new development on a property in a region or location.\n        (4) A regulated entitys developer charges policy must be published on the entitys website for the period for which the policy is to apply.\n        (5) A regulated entitys developer charges policy is to require the entity to provide an estimate of the amount of the developer charge that is to apply, in respect of a property, to a person who –\n                (a) proposes a new development in respect of the property; and\n                (b) provides, to the entity, sufficient information as to the proposals for the new development to enable an estimate to be determined; and\n                (c) requests that an estimate be provided to the person.\n        (6) A regulated entitys developer charges policy is to require the entity to provide information, as to how the amount of a charge has been determined by the entity, to a person –\n                (a) on whom a developer charge is imposed; and\n                (b) who requests the information to be provided to the person.\n\n8.

Additional pricing principles\n    The provisions in this Part specify pricing principles that apply, in addition to the pricing principles set out in section 68 of the Act, in relation to prices for the provision of a regulated service.\n\n10. Full cost recovery from certain contracts\n        (1) Prices for the provision of a regulated service by a regulated entity to a customer, under a relevant contract, are to allow for the recovery of the full cost of providing the service to the customer.\n        (2) For the purposes of subregulation (1) , a relevant contract means –\n                (a) a contract, other than a customer contract, that was in force immediately before 22 September 2011 and is still in force; or\n                (b) a contract entered into pursuant to section 61 of the Act.\n\n11. No double-dipping\n    A cost of providing a regulated service to a customer must not be included in a charge imposed on the customer if the cost has been, or is to be, recouped by the imposition on the customer of another charge.\n\n12. Contributed assets\n        (1) Prices for the provision of a regulated service are not to be set so as to allow for either of the following:\n                (a) a rate of return in respect of contributed assets;\n                (b) depreciation of contributed assets.\n        (2) Despite subregulation (1) , prices for the provision of a regulated service are to be set so as to allow for the recovery of expenses incurred by a regulated entity in respect of the operation or maintenance of a contributed asset.\n        (3) Subregulation (1) does not apply in relation to a contributed asset of a regulated entity that has been –\n                (a) transferred, granted, or given by way of a gift, to the regulated entity by the Crown or an emanation of the Crown, after 22 September 2011; or\n                (b) constructed by the regulated entity using funds provided by the Crown or an emanation of the Crown after 22 September 2011 –\n        if the arrangement or transaction under which the asset became an asset of the entity specifies that the return on the assets is to be not more than a rate that reflects the regulatory and commercial risks involved in providing the regulated service.\n\nDivision 2 - Particular charges\n\n13. Service introduction charges\n        (1) A service introduction charge must not be imposed on a person in relation to a property unless the person is an owner of the property.\n        (2) The amount of a service introduction charge imposed on a person in relation to a property is not to be more than is necessary to recoup the reasonable costs incurred by a regulated entity in installing, altering or utilising its assets so as to be able to provide a regulated service to the property.\n        (3) For the purposes of subregulation (2) , the reasonable costs incurred by a regulated entity are –\n                (a) the costs directly attributable to installing, altering or utilising its assets in a reasonably cost-efficient manner so as to be able to provide a regulated service to the property; and\n                (b) to be calculated so as to reflect variations in the costs of providing the regulated service to different locations or regions.\n        (4) A service introduction charge may be imposed on a person in addition to a fixed charge.\n\n14. Fixed charges\n        (1) A fixed charge for a regulated service is to reflect the costs to the regulated entity that –\n                (a) are reasonably attributable to providing the service to the property to which the charge relates; and\n                (b) are not recouped through a developer charge or service introduction charge.\n        (2) A fixed charge for a regulated service in relation to a property must not be imposed on a person in relation to residential premises situated on the property unless the person is an owner of the residential premises.\n\n15. Imposition of variable charges\n        (1) A regulated entity must charge a variable charge for a water service.\n        (2) A regulated entity may, but is not required to, charge a variable charge for a sewerage service.\n        (3) A variable charge that is imposed for a regulated service must be charged in respect of each unit of water delivered to, or sewage removed from, the property to which the charge relates.\n        (4) The rate of a variable charge to be charged by a regulated entity must not be less than the cost of delivering water to, or removing sewage from, the property to which the charge relates.\n        (5) A variable charge for a regulated service is to reflect the costs, to the regulated entity, that are reasonably attributable to the volume of water delivered to, or sewage remove from, the property to which the charge relates.\n        (6) Despite subregulation (5) , the rate of variable charge to be charged by a regulated entity in respect of a regulated service may be greater than the cost of delivering water to, or removing sewage from, the property, if –\n                (a) there are constraints on the amount of water available to be provided by the entity or the capacity of water treatment plants or sewage treatment plants; or\n                (b) there are constraints on the capacity of the regulated entitys infrastructure; or\n                (c) it is desirable to do so to reduce demand for the supply of water, or removal of sewage, for the relevant purpose; or\n                (d) the Regulator is of the opinion that the rate should be greater than the cost so as to enable the regulated entity to recoup any costs that may not otherwise be recouped by the regulated entity.\n        (7) For the purposes of subregulation (6)(c) , the relevant purpose for reducing demand for the supply of water, or removal of sewage, is so as to enable the expenditure in relation to assets that would otherwise be required to meet increased demand for the service to be deferred so that expenditure, in relation to assets, for the purposes of improving health, public safety or the environment may occur instead.\n\n16. When variable charges may not be imposed\n        (1) A variable charge for a water service must not be imposed, in relation to residential premises situated on a property, on a person other than the owner of the residential premises.\n        (2) All or part of an amount of a variable charge, for a water service in relation to property that is common property, must not be imposed on a person, other than a body corporate formed under the Strata Titles Act 1998 , unless –\n                (a) the person is the owner of a lot that forms part of the scheme to which the common property relates; and\n                (b) the amount of the charge imposed on the person consists of the proportion, of the variable charge in relation to the common property, determined by apportioning the charge –\n                        (i) on the basis of the general unit entitlement of the lot; or\n                        (ii) if there is in respect of the lot a special unit entitlement for liability for charges for water use, on the basis of the special unit entitlement.\n\n17. Metering of amounts of variable charges\n        (1) If there is, on the area of land to which a scheme relates, only one meter in respect of a water service provided to the land, a regulated entity must not impose on a person, other than a body corporate formed under the Strata Titles Act 1998 , a variable charge for the water service, unless –\n                (a) the person is the owner of a lot that forms part of the scheme; and\n                (b) the amount of the charge imposed on the person consists of the proportion, of the variable charge in relation to the area of land, determined by apportioning the charge –\n                        (i) on the basis of the general unit entitlement of the lot; or\n                        (ii) if there is in respect of the lot a special unit entitlement for liability for charges for water use, on the basis of the special unit entitlement.\n        (2) A variable charge for a water service, or a sewerage service, provided to a property must, if a meter in respect of the service is installed on the property and is working accurately, be calculated having regard to the records of the meter.\n        (3) If a water meter is not working accurately, registers incorrectly or is removed from a property for any reason, a regulated entity may, for the purposes of determining the amount of a variable charge to be imposed in respect of the property, estimate the amount of water delivered to the property for each day during a period –\n                (a) based on the average amount of water supplied to the property under similar conditions on each day in another period; or\n                (b) based on the average amount of water supplied to the property on each day in another period after the meter is repaired or replaced; or\n                (c) by applying a correction factor, if the meter is found to have a consistent error in registering the amount of water being delivered.\n\n18. Developer charges\n    A regulated entity may impose, in respect of a property to which a proposed new development relates, a charge that relates to the installation, alteration or utilisation of assets by the regulated entity so as to enable the provision by the entity of regulated services for the purposes of the new development.\n\n19. Amount of developer charges\n        (1) The amount of a developer charge to be imposed by a regulated entity in respect of a property to which a proposed new development relates is to be sufficient to, but no higher than is necessary to, recoup the reasonable costs incurred by the entity in respect of the proposed new development.\n        (2) For the purposes of subregulation (1) , the reasonable costs incurred by a regulated entity in respect of a proposed new development –\n                (a) are those costs directly attributable to installing, altering, or utilising assets, in a reasonably cost-efficient manner, so as to be able to provide a regulated service in respect of the proposed new development; and\n                (b) may reflect variations in the costs of servicing different locations or regions; and\n                (c) may include an excess capacity cost; and\n                (d) are not to include an amount attributable to increased external demand by existing customers.\n        (3) For the purposes of subregulation (2)(c) , an excess capacity cost is an amount that is –\n                (a) attributable to –\n                        (i) the cost of installing, before the proposed new development came into existence, assets which had an excess capacity such that regulated services are able to be provided in respect of the new development without altering the assets; and\n                        (ii) the cost of altering or utilising assets that were installed before the proposed new development came into existence so that regulated services are able to be provided in respect of the new development without installing new assets; and\n                (b) proportional to the amount of that excess capacity that is to be utilised in providing the regulated services in respect of that new development.\n        (4) For the purposes of subregulation (2)(d) , an amount is attributable to increased external demand by existing customers if it is attributable to installing, altering, or utilising assets so as to meet increased demand, for the regulated service, that is –\n                (a) from a connection, or connections, made before the new development to which the charge relates was completed; and\n                (b) greater than anticipated in relation to that connection, or those connections, at the time of the installation, alteration, or utilisation of the assets.\n        (5) The amount of a developer charge to be imposed in respect of a property by a regulated entity may, if the regulated entity agrees, be reduced by an amount that –\n                (a) is equivalent to the value of a contributed asset to be provided to the regulated entity by a person in respect of the property; and\n                (b) would have otherwise constituted all or part of the amount of the developer charge.\n        (6) A regulated entity must not unreasonably refuse to agree under subregulation (5) to a reduction in the amount of a developer charge.\n\n20. Miscellaneous fees and charges\n    A price determination is to require a price and service plan to include all fees and charges that may be charged by a regulated entity that are not fixed charges, variable charges, developer charges or service introduction charges.\n\nPART 4 - Price Determination Investigations\n\n21. Price determination investigations\n        (1) In this regulation –\n            excluded amount means –\n                    (a) an income tax, income tax equivalent, fringe benefits tax or capital gains tax; or\n                    (b) a tax, charge, levy, duty or imposition that replaces a tax referred to in paragraph (a) ; or\n                    (c) a fee or charge payable under the Act; or\n                    (d) an amount payable under a contract; or\n                    (e) a fine or other penalty;\n            relevant tax means a tax, charge, levy, duty, or imposition, other than an excluded amount, that –\n                    (a) is directly attributable to the provision of a regulated service; and\n                    (b) in the opinion of the Regulator, is not normally absorbed by a business in a fully competitive market;\n            tax event, in relation to a price determination, means –\n                    (a) the imposition on a regulated entity of an obligation to pay an amount which –\n                            (i) it was not obligated to pay immediately before the price determination was made; and\n                            (ii) arises from the imposition of a relevant tax; or\n                    (b) a change in the manner in which, or the rate at which, a relevant tax is calculated, which results in a change in an amount that a regulated entity is required to pay (whether directly or by reason of an adjustment under a contract of an amount payable under that contract) in respect of relevant taxes, from the amount that the entity was so required to pay immediately before the price determination was made; or\n                    (c) the removal of a relevant tax, which removal results in a change in an amount that a regulated entity is required to pay (whether directly or by reason of an adjustment under a contract of an amount payable under that contract) from the amount that the entity was so required to pay immediately before the price determination was made.\n        (2) The Regulator must conduct a price determination investigation before making, or varying, a price determination in respect of a regulated service.\n        (3) Subregulation (2) does not apply in relation to a variation, of a price determination, that varies prices specified in the price determination if that variation is, in the opinion of the Regulator, required because there has been a material change in the costs incurred by a regulated entity as a result of –\n                (a) complying with new or additional legislative requirements; or\n                (b) a tax event after the price determination that is to be varied is made.\n\n22.
