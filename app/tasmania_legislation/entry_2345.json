Application for grant or renewal of local practising certificate\n                (1) An Australian lawyer may apply to the prescribed authority for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate if eligible to do so under this section.\n                (2) An Australian lawyer is eligible to apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate if the lawyer complies with any regulations and legal profession rules relating to eligibility for the practising certificate and if –\n                        (a) in the case of a lawyer who is not an Australian legal practitioner at the time of making the application –\n                                (i) the lawyer reasonably expects to be engaged in legal practice solely or principally in this jurisdiction during the currency of the certificate or renewal applied for; or\n                                (ii) if subparagraph (i) does not apply to the lawyer or it is not reasonably practicable to determine whether subparagraph (i) applies to the lawyer, the lawyers place of residence in Australia is this jurisdiction or the lawyer does not have a place of residence in Australia; or\n                        (b) in the case of a lawyer who is an Australian legal practitioner at the time of making the application –\n                                (i) the jurisdiction in which the lawyer engages in legal practice solely or principally is this jurisdiction; or\n                                (ii) the lawyer holds a current local practising certificate and engages in legal practice in another jurisdiction under an arrangement that is of a temporary nature; or\n                                (iii) the lawyer reasonably expects to be engaged in legal practice solely or principally in this jurisdiction during the currency of the certificate or renewal applied for; or\n                                (iv) if subparagraph (i) , (ii) or (iii) does not apply to the lawyer or it is not reasonably practicable to determine whether subparagraph (i) , (ii) or (iii) applies to the lawyer, the lawyers place of residence in Australia is this jurisdiction or the lawyer does not have a place of residence in Australia.\n                (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) , the jurisdiction in which an Australian lawyer engages in legal practice solely or principally is to be decided by reference to the lawyers legal practice during the certificate period current at the time –\n                        (a) the application is made; or\n                        (b) in the case of a late application, the application should have been made.\n                (4) An Australian lawyer is not eligible to apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate in respect of a financial year if the lawyer would also be the holder of another Australian practising certificate for that year, but this subsection does not limit the factors determining ineligibility to apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate.\n                (5) An Australian lawyer must not apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate if the lawyer is not eligible to make the application.\n                (6) An Australian legal practitioner who –\n                        (a) engages in legal practice solely or principally in this jurisdiction during a financial year; and\n                        (b) reasonably expects to engage in legal practice solely or principally in this jurisdiction in the following financial year –\n                must apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate in respect of the following financial year.\n                (7) Subsection (6) does not apply to an interstate legal practitioner who applied for the grant or renewal of an interstate practising certificate on the basis that the practitioner reasonably expected to engage in legal practice solely or principally in this jurisdiction under an arrangement that is of a temporary nature.\n                (8) The exemption provided by subsection (7) ceases to operate at the end of the period prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.\n                (9) A reference in this section to engaging in legal practice principally in this or any other jurisdiction applies only to legal practice in Australia. Accordingly, an Australian lawyer who is engaged or expects to be engaged in legal practice principally in a foreign country is nevertheless eligible to apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate if the lawyer otherwise meets the requirements of this section so that eligibility is determined by reference to the person's practice in Australia.\n\n        49.

Advice relating to grant or renewal of local practising certificates\n                (1) The prescribed authority must advise the Board of an application for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate.\n                (2) The Board must advise the prescribed authority of any disciplinary action taken under Chapter 4 .\n                (3) The prescribed authority may take into account any matter referred to it in subsection (2) .\n\n        51.

Section 52 authorises the charging of a late fee for applications received during the late fee period. If an application is rejected under subsection (3) , the applicant will have to apply for the grant of a new local practising certificate.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n                        \n\n            52.

Obligations and privileges of practitioners who are officers or employees\n                                    (1) An Australian legal practitioner who provides legal services on behalf of an incorporated legal practice in the capacity of an officer or employee of the practice –\n                                            (a) is not excused from compliance with professional obligations as an Australian legal practitioner, or any obligations as an Australian legal practitioner under any law; and\n                                            (b) does not lose the professional privileges of an Australian legal practitioner.\n                                    (2) For the purposes only of subsection (1) , the professional obligations and professional privileges of a practitioner apply as if –\n                                            (a) where there are 2 or more legal practitioner directors of an incorporated legal practice, the practice were a partnership of the legal practitioner directors and the employees of the practice were employees of the legal practitioner directors; or\n                                            (b) where there is only one legal practitioner director of an incorporated legal practice, the practice were a sole practitioner and the employees of the practice were employees of the legal practitioner director.\n                                    (3) The law relating to client legal privilege (or other legal professional privilege) is not excluded or otherwise affected because an Australian legal practitioner is acting in the capacity of an officer or employee of an incorporated legal practice.\n                                    (4) The directors of an incorporated legal practice do not breach their duties as directors merely because legal services are provided pro bono by an Australian legal practitioner employed by the practice.\n\n                            122. Conflicts of interest\n                                    (1) For the purposes of the application of any law (including the common law) or legal profession rules relating to conflicts of interest to the conduct of an Australian legal practitioner who is –\n                                            (a) a legal practitioner director of an incorporated legal practice; or\n                                            (b) an officer or employee of an incorporated legal practice –\n                                    the interests of the incorporated legal practice or any related body corporate are also taken to be those of the practitioner (in addition to any interests that the practitioner has apart from this subsection).\n                                    (2) Legal profession rules may be made for or with respect to additional duties and obligations in connection with conflicts of interest arising out of the conduct of an incorporated legal practice.\n                                    Note. Under section 121 (Obligations and privileges of practitioners who are officers or employees), an Australian legal practitioner who is an officer or employee of an incorporated legal practice must comply with the same professional obligations as other practitioners.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n                                123. Disclosure obligations\n                                        (1) This section applies if a person engages an incorporated legal practice to provide services that the person might reasonably assume to be legal services, but does not apply where the practice provides only legal services in this jurisdiction.\n                                        (2) Each legal practitioner director of the incorporated legal practice, and any employee who is an Australian legal practitioner and who provides the services on behalf of the practice, must ensure that a disclosure, complying with the requirements of this section and the regulations made for the purposes of this section, is made to the person in connection with the provision of the services.\n                                        Penalty: Fine not exceeding 50 penalty units.\n                                        (3) The disclosure must be made by giving the person a notice in writing –\n                                                (a) setting out the services to be provided; and\n                                                (b) stating whether or not all the legal services to be provided will be provided by an Australian legal practitioner; and\n                                                (c) if some or all of the legal services to be provided will not be provided by an Australian legal practitioner, identifying those services and indicating the status or qualifications of the person or persons who will provide the services; and\n                                                Note. For example, the person might be a licensed conveyancer. However, this paragraph would not apply in a case where a law applying in the jurisdiction prohibits a particular legal service from being provided by a person who is not an Australian legal practitioner.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                \n                                                    (d) stating that this Act applies to the provision of legal services but not to the provision of the non-legal services.\n                                            (4) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the following matters:\n                                                    (a) the manner in which a disclosure is to be made;\n                                                    (b) additional matters required to be disclosed in connection with the provision of legal services or non-legal services by an incorporated legal practice.\n                                            (5) Without limiting subsection (4) , the additional matters may include the kind of services provided by the incorporated legal practice and whether those services are or are not covered by the insurance or other provisions of this Act.\n                                            (6) A disclosure under this section to a person about the provision of legal services may relate to the provision of legal services on one occasion or on more than one occasion or on an on-going basis.\n\n                                    124. Effect of non-disclosure of provision of certain services\n                                            (1) This section applies if –\n                                                    (a) section 123 applies in relation to a service that is provided to a person who has engaged an incorporated legal practice to provide the service and that the person might reasonably assume to be a legal service; and\n                                                    (b) a disclosure has not been made under that section in relation to the service.\n                                            (2) The standard of care owed by the incorporated legal practice in respect of the service is the standard that would be applicable if the service had been provided by an Australian legal practitioner.\n\n                                    125. Application of legal profession rules\n                                        Legal profession rules, so far as they apply to Australian legal practitioners, also apply to Australian legal practitioners who are officers or employees of an incorporated legal practice, unless the rules otherwise provide.\n\n                                    126. Requirements relating to advertising\n                                            (1) Any restriction imposed by or under this or any other Act, the regulations or the legal profession rules in connection with advertising by Australian legal practitioners applies to advertising by an incorporated legal practice with respect to the provision of legal services.\n                                            (2) If a restriction referred to in subsection (1) is limited to a particular branch of the legal profession or to persons who practise in a particular style of legal practice, the restriction applies only to the extent that the incorporated legal practice carries on the business in that branch of the legal profession or in that style of legal practice.\n                                            (3) Any advertisement of the kind referred to in this section is, for the purposes of disciplinary proceedings taken against an Australian legal practitioner, taken to have been authorised by each legal practitioner director of the incorporated legal practice.\n                                            (4) This section does not apply if the provision by which the restriction is imposed expressly excludes its application to incorporated legal practices.\n\n                                    127.

Banning of incorporated legal practices\n                                                (1) The Supreme Court may, on the application of the prescribed authority, make an order disqualifying a corporation from providing legal services in this jurisdiction for the period the Court considers appropriate if satisfied that –\n                                                        (a) a ground for disqualifying the corporation under this section has been established; and\n                                                        (b) the disqualification is justified.\n                                                (2) An order under this section may, if the Supreme Court thinks it appropriate, be made –\n                                                        (a) subject to conditions as to the conduct of the incorporated legal practice; or\n                                                        (b) subject to conditions as to when or in what circumstances the order is to take effect; or\n                                                        (c) together with orders to safeguard the interests of clients or employees of the incorporated legal practice.\n                                                (3) Action may be taken against an incorporated legal practice on any of the following grounds:\n                                                        (a) that a legal practitioner director or an Australian legal practitioner who is a officer or employee of the corporation is found guilty of professional misconduct under a law of this jurisdiction or another jurisdiction;\n                                                        (b) that the prescribed authority is satisfied, after conducting an audit of the incorporated legal practice, that the incorporated legal practice has failed to implement satisfactory management and supervision of its provision of legal services;\n                                                        (c) that the incorporated legal practice (or a related body corporate) has contravened section 113 (Non-legal services and businesses of incorporated legal practices) or the regulations made under that section;\n                                                        (d) that the incorporated legal practice has contravened section 129 (Disqualified persons);\n                                                        (e) that a person who is an officer of the incorporated legal practice and who is the subject of an order under –\n                                                                (i) section 133 or under provisions of a corresponding law that correspond to that section; or\n                                                                (ii) section 158 (Prohibition on partnerships with certain partners who are not Australian legal practitioners) or under provisions of a corresponding law that correspond to that section –\n                                                        is acting in the management of the incorporated legal practice.\n                                                (4) If a corporation is disqualified under this section, the prescribed authority must, as soon as practicable, notify the corresponding authority of every other jurisdiction.\n                                                (5) If a corporation is disqualified from providing legal services in another jurisdiction under a corresponding law, the prescribed authority may determine that the corporation is taken to be disqualified from providing legal services in this jurisdiction for the same period, but nothing in this subsection prevents the prescribed authority from instead applying for an order under this section.\n                                                (6) A corporation that provides legal services in contravention of a disqualification under this section is guilty of an offence.\n                                                Penalty: Fine not exceeding 500 penalty units.\n                                                (7) A corporation that is disqualified under this section ceases to be an incorporated legal practice.\n                                                (8) Conduct of an Australian legal practitioner who provides legal services on behalf of a corporation in the capacity of an officer or employee of the corporation is capable of constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct where the practitioner ought reasonably to have known that the corporation is disqualified under this section.\n                                                (9) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the publication and notification of orders made under this section, including notification of appropriate authorities of other jurisdictions.\n\n                                        133.

The relevant jurisdiction for an associate is in some cases the associates home jurisdiction.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                    (2) In the case of a default involving trust money received in Australia (whether or not it was paid into an Australian trust account), the relevant jurisdiction for the associate is –\n                                                                                                                            (a) if the trust money was paid into an Australian trust account and if the associate (whether alone or with a co-signatory) was authorised to withdraw any or all of the trust money from the only or last Australian trust account in which the trust money was held before the default, the jurisdiction under whose law that trust account was maintained; or\n                                                                                                                            (b) in any other case, the associates home jurisdiction.\n                                                                                                                    (3) In the case of a default involving trust money received outside Australia and paid into an Australian trust account, the relevant jurisdiction for the associate is –\n                                                                                                                            (a) if the associate (whether alone or with a co-signatory) was authorised to withdraw any or all of the trust money from the only or last Australian trust account in which the trust money was held before the default, the jurisdiction under whose law that trust account was maintained; or\n                                                                                                                            (b) in any other case, the associates home jurisdiction.\n                                                                                                                    (4) In the case of a default involving trust property received in Australia, or received outside Australia and brought to Australia, the relevant jurisdiction for the associate is the associates home jurisdiction.\n                                                                                                                    Note. Section 398 (Defaults involving interstate elements where committed by one associate only) provides that the Trust may treat the default as consisting of 2 or more defaults for the purpose of determining the liability of the Guarantee Fund or Fidelity Fund.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                    \n\n                                                                                                                365.
