and\n                        (ii) the implementation of the major infrastructure project will not by reason of that improvement be made more difficult; or\n                (c) a permit which describes a corridor has been granted in accordance with subsection (8) and the improvement is outside that corridor; or\n                (d) the order under section 7(2) which gave rise to the notified corridor has been revoked; or\n                (e) the improvement arises in connection with a use or development comprised in the major infrastructure project.\n        (17) Compensation is not payable under this section in respect of injurious affection for which compensation is paid under the Land Acquisition Act 1993 .\n        (18) In this section –\n            initial proponent means the proponent who was identified in the order made under section 7(2) .\n\n14A. Amended corridors\n        (1) The proponent of a major infrastructure project may request the Minister to amend a notified corridor.\n        (2) The request is to be accompanied by a plan of the proposed amended corridor.\n        (3) A plan for the purposes of subsection (2) is to identify the boundaries of the proposed amended corridor with sufficient accuracy to enable an owner of land to determine whether or not that land will be affected by the amended corridor.\n        (4) If the Minister is satisfied that it is reasonable to amend a notified corridor, the Minister must cause notice of the amended corridor to be served on –\n                (a) the Commission; and\n                (b) each planning authority on which obligations are imposed by the order under section 7(2) or which is otherwise affected by the amended corridor; and\n                (c) each owner of land added to the notified corridor by the amendment of that corridor; and\n                (d) each owner of land deleted from the notified corridor by the amendment of that corridor.\n        (4A) A notice for the purpose of subsection (4) that is required to be served on an owner that is a company may be served by post on the owner at the postal address of the owner in the valuation roll prepared under section 24 of the Valuation of Land Act 2001 .\n        (5) The Commission must, in the performance of its functions and exercise of its powers, have regard to any notice which is served on it under subsection (4) .\n        (6) A planning authority must, in the performance of its functions and exercise of its powers, have regard to any notice which is served on it under subsection (4) .\n        (7) Notice to an owner of land for the purposes of subsection (4)(c) is to –\n                (a) be served no later than the time at which notice of the making of an application for a permit in respect of that land is served under section 11(2)(b) ; and\n                (b) contain such information as is prescribed for the purposes of section 14(6)(b) ; and\n                (c) be accompanied by a copy of that part of the plan referred to in subsection (2) which relates to the owner's land.\n        (8) A corridor of which notice has been served by the Minister under subsection (4) , whether before or after the commencement of the Major Infrastructure Development Approvals Amendment Act (No. 2) 2001 , is a notified corridor notwithstanding –\n                (a) a failure to serve each owner of land required to be served; or\n                (b) a failure to serve each owner of land by the time required by subsection (7)(a) ; or\n                (c) a deficiency in the notice; or\n                (d) a failure to comply with subsection (7)(c) in respect of each owner of land required to be served.\n\n14B.

or\n                (b) the Minister has caused notice of the application to be served upon any such owner who has not consented to the proposed amendment, and the Minister has taken into account any representations made to the Minister by that owner within –\n                        (i) a period of 7 days after personal service of the notice; or\n                        (ii) a period of 14 days after service of the notice by post.\n        (9) The Minister must cause a copy of an order which is made under this section to be served as soon as practicable on –\n                (a) the proponent;

Establishment and membership of combined planning authority\n        (1) A combined planning authority is established by an instrument in writing signed by the Minister which appoints the members of the combined planning authority and a deputy for each of those persons on the nomination of the specified planning authorities.\n        (2) Subject to this section, a specified planning authority is to have the number of representatives which is specified in respect of the specified planning authority in the order declaring the major infrastructure project.\n        (3) If an order under section 7(2) declares that the planning approval process in respect of the major infrastructure project is to be administered by a combined planning authority, each specified planning authority must, within 28 days of the receipt by the specified planning authority of notice from the Minister under section 7(7) , nominate in writing to the Minister the persons to be appointed by the Minister to the combined planning authority as members and deputy members representing the specified planning authority.\n        (4) The Minister must establish the combined planning authority within 14 days of receiving all of the nominations required under subsection (3) .\n        (5) The Minister may remove a person from the combined planning authority following consultation with the specified planning authority which nominated that person to the combined planning authority.\n        (6) A person may, by notice to the Minister, resign as a member or deputy member of a combined planning authority.\n        (7) If a vacancy arises on a combined planning authority, the specified planning authority which nominated the person who is to be replaced may nominate a person to fill the vacancy and the Minister must appoint the person so nominated to fill that vacancy.\n        (8) When appointing a deputy member to a combined planning authority, the Minister is to specify the member of the combined planning authority for whom the deputy member is the deputy.\n        (9) If a member of a combined planning authority is unable for any reason to perform the duties of a member, the member's deputy may perform those duties and, when doing so, is taken to be that member.\n\n17. Powers and functions of combined planning authority\n        (1) A combined planning authority established by the Minister under section 16 in accordance with an order under section 7(2) –\n                (a) is a body corporate with the name given to it in the order; and\n                (b) has perpetual succession; and\n                (c) has a seal; and\n                (d) may sue and be sued in its corporate name.\n        (2) Subject to this Act, the combined planning authority –\n                (a) is taken, for all purposes in connection with the major infrastructure project, to be the planning authority which administers each planning scheme or special planning order under which a permit is required for the implementation of the major infrastructure project; and\n                (b) is the sole planning authority with responsibility for –\n                        (i) the receipt of any application for a permit for a use or development comprised in the major infrastructure project; and\n                        (ii) the setting of fees for such an application; and\n                        (iii) exercising the powers and performing the functions of the planning authority under any relevant planning scheme or special planning order in relation to the application; and\n                        (iv) exercising the powers and performing the functions of a planning authority under any Act in relation to the application; and\n                        (v) correcting a permit, granted by the combined planning authority, in accordance with section 55 of the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 ; and\n                        (vi) amending a permit, granted by the combined planning authority, in accordance with section 56 of the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 ; and\n                        (vii) enforcing a permit granted by the combined planning authority until the combined planning authority issues a certificate in accordance with section 17A .\n        (3) Any appeal under the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 in respect of the grant or amendment of a permit granted by a combined planning authority is to be taken against the combined planning authority.\n        (4) . . . . . . . .\n        (5) The fee imposed by a combined planning authority for an application for a permit may be fixed with reference to the reasonable cost of the performance by the combined planning authority of its functions including the costs of carrying out an assessment of the proposal but not including the costs of enforcing a permit granted by the combined planning authority.\n        (6) A combined planning authority may impose a further fee in respect of an application for a permit after receipt of that application, in order to recoup previously unanticipated costs reasonably incurred by the combined planning authority in the performance of its functions including the costs of carrying out an assessment of the proposal but not including the costs of enforcing a permit granted by the combined planning authority.\n        (7) Notwithstanding any other law, a combined planning authority may refuse to grant a permit until fees imposed in accordance with subsections (5) and (6) have been paid.\n        (8) The refusal of a combined planning authority to grant a permit until fees imposed in accordance with subsections (5) and (6) have been paid is not a failure to determine the application for the permit for the purposes of section 59 of the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 .\n        (9) A combined planning authority may recover the reasonable costs of enforcing a permit granted by the combined planning authority from the holder of the permit.\n        (10) Costs which are payable to a combined planning authority under subsection (9) may be recovered as a debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n        (11) In determining whether costs which have been incurred by a combined planning authority in enforcing a condition or restriction of a permit are reasonable, a court is to have regard to whether the Crown has undertaken to enforce that condition or restriction.\n\n17AA. Enforcement of conditions or restrictions of permit\n    For the avoidance of doubt, a condition or restriction of a permit granted by a combined planning authority is taken to be a condition or restriction imposed by a planning authority pursuant to a planning scheme or special planning order and may be enforced under section 63 or 64 of the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 by the combined planning authority or by a planning authority which has received a certificate under section 17A(1) in respect of the permit.\n\n17A. Subsequent enforcement of permit by planning authority\n        (1) If a combined planning authority is satisfied that all works authorised or required by a permit granted by the combined planning authority have been completed, the combined planning authority is to issue a certificate to that effect to each planning authority which normally administers a planning scheme or special planning order which is relevant to the works to which the certificate relates.\n        (2) A combined planning authority which issues a certificate under subsection (1) is to give a copy of the certificate to the holder of the permit.\n        (3) A planning authority to which a certificate is issued under subsection (1) is responsible for the enforcement of the permit to which the certificate relates to the extent that the permit deals with matters which would normally be within the jurisdiction of the planning authority.\n        (4) A planning authority which, under subsection (3) , is responsible for the enforcement of a permit may recover the reasonable costs of enforcing the permit from the holder of the permit.\n        (5) Costs which are payable to a planning authority under subsection (4) may be recovered as a debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n18.
